<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>Having often been requested by different magistrates,
to investigate cases of sharping, I have often
been struck, while doing so, with the obstacles and
embarrassments which a judge's own honesty must
oppose to his elucidation of matters of sharping
and cheating at play.</p>

<p>How is it possible that he can penetrate the
subtile web, with which the sharper surrounds his
dupes,&mdash;how can he be able to detect the tricks
of these rogues,&mdash;if he does not understand the
manœuvres of sleight-of-hand?</p>

<p>By a singular reversal of the ordinary conditions
of justice, the magistrate finds himself most
powerless, when the rogue has committed the most
daring, and artfully cunning, frauds.</p>

<p>A great portion of my life having been devoted
to the study of sleight-of-hand, and having, as yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
only made use of my knowledge for the amusement
of my fellow-creatures, I felt that the time
had arrived, when I ought to give to the public,
who had so honoured me with their favour, an
unequivocal mark of my gratitude, by consecrating
my leisure hours to their service.</p>

<p>I have therefore written this work, the moral
and end of which may be summed up in this
incontestable truth:</p>

<p>
"<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Éclairez les dupes, il n'y aura plus de fripons.</span>"<br />
<br />
"Enlighten the dupes, and there will be no more knaves."
</p>

<p>There is no reason, however, because a fact
is incontestable, that it will not be contested;
indeed, I am of opinion that it will be, and, as
a proof of what I state, I am myself going to
offer an objection which might be made on this
subject.</p>

<p>In disclosing the secrets of sharpers, people will
say, Do you not fear to create in the minds of
unfortunate gamblers, a wish to try and better
their fortunes, by the very means you point out
to warn them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span>
I have been guided by an opinion, repeatedly
expressed by the editors of newspapers, and the
press in general; and, in answer to the objection I
have made above, I beg to say, that in the explanations
I have given of the tricks of sharpers, though
I have said enough to put people on their guard,
I have not said enough to teach them how to
execute these tricks.</p>

<p>If I had not taken this precaution, what would
have been the result?</p>

<p>It is only one individual, already half perverted,
who will avail himself of the knowledge I impart,
to learn to cheat, while hundreds of dupes will
have been put on their guard.</p>

<p>If these revelations serve to awaken vicious
ideas in perverted minds, what can be said of the
various works on the laws of duelling, in which
you can learn how to kill your neighbour according
to rule?</p>

<p>Is it not to be feared, that the opinions contained
in those books may lead to crime?</p>

<p>For my part, I have so good an opinion of
mankind in general, that I trust the perusal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
this work will only tend to their benefit, and
prove their safeguard against rogues. Let each
person when he sits down to play, strengthened
by the hints and instructions I have given him,
look with suspicion on all "Greeks" (as these
sharpers are sometimes called), and let him recollect
to his profit this verse of Virgil:</p>

SHARPER DETECTED AND EXPOSED.</h2>

<hr />
<h2><a name="ANECDOTE" id="ANECDOTE">AN ANECDOTE BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION.</a><br />
<span class="subhead">A DANGEROUS PROFESSOR.</span></h2>

<p>Whatever, dear reader, may be the value you
attach to the knowledge of the knaveries I am
about to reveal to you, you will assuredly never pay
so dearly for them as I have.</p>

<p>You will easily understand, that the tricks and
impostures exposed in this work, are not the inventions
of my own brain. I have collected them, one
by one, from sharpers, or have been obliged to find
them out as best I could.</p>

<p>My researches have been both difficult and dangerous.
Sharpers do not willingly part with the
arts on which they depend for their livelihood; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
moreover, you are driven, by your investigations, into
a society which may often expose you to serious
personal risk.</p>

<p>When I was but a novice in the art of legerdemain,
I often went, as I have mentioned in my
"Confessions," to the house of a manufacturer
of articles used for jugglery, named Père Roujol,
hoping to meet there some lover of magic, or professor
of the art of legerdemain.</p>

<p>The kind Père Roujol had taken a great fancy
to me; he knew my passion for what he termed
"natural philosophy rendered amusing," and took
pleasure in giving me these opportunities of obtaining
useful hints on the subject.</p>

<p>He spoke to me one day, of a man named Elias
Hausheer, whom he had met at a "café."</p>

<p>"This man," said he to me, "appears very clever,
but from a few words he let fall, it strikes me that
he makes more use of his dexterity in winning
at play, than for the harmless amusement of the
public."</p>

<p>Hausheer's character was of little consequence to
me; he might be the greatest blackleg in Paris;
I only cared to know that he was clever, and I
hoped to learn from him a good deal that would
be useful.</p>

<p>I thanked my old friend for his information, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
decided to call on M. Hausheer the following
morning about ten o'clock.</p>

<p>I was at this time only known as a mechanician,
and I feared that my being so, would hardly procure
me an introduction to the great man.</p>

<p>An idea just then crossed my brain; I had
recently invented a little mechanical bird, which
sang and hopped about on the top of a snuff-box.
I thought that perhaps this work of art, a very
valuable one, by-the-bye, would serve my purpose,
and I took it with me.</p>

<p>Feeling more confidence in the result of my visit,
I directed my steps towards the Rue de l'Écu d'Or,
where the great man in question resided. I say
great man, not in a spirit of irony, but because,
in my monomania, my imagination pictured M.
Hausheer as having a large fortune, and all other
advantages in keeping with his wonderful talents.</p>

<p>I did not know the Rue de l'Écu d'Or at all. I
was much surprised, on arriving there, at its miserable
and poverty-stricken appearance, but without
stopping to reflect on this first disenchantment,
I walked on until I came to No. 8, which was
the address mentioned on the card I held in my
hand.</p>

<p>A long, straight alley, damp and dirty, served
as an entrance to the house. I entered it resolutely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
"Does M. Hausheer live here?" I asked, rapping
on one of the dingy-looking panes of a sort of
glass-box, over which the word "Porter," was
written.</p>

<p>A man with a grey beard, cut to a peak, like a
well-pointed pencil, with a bootjack in one hand,
and a boot in the other, opened one of the panes,
and with a strong German accent, asked me what
I wanted.</p>

<p>"M. Hausheer," I replied.</p>

<p>"I don't know such a person: there are none but
Germans in this house."</p>

<p>"Well," replied I, "if I may judge from the
name I've just mentioned, the person I want
ought to be a German."</p>

<p>I presented the card which I held in my hand.</p>

<p>The polisher of boots put on his spectacles,
and after having read the name of his lodger,
said:</p>

<p>"Ah! M. Hhhaoushheer," aspirating, with great
force, the letter H, as if to give me a lesson in
pronouncing the German language. "Yes, yes, he
lives on the second floor, at the end of the corridor,
to the left."</p>

<p>Thus instructed, I mounted the staircase until I
reached the second story, proceeding along a dark
corridor, at the end of which I discovered a door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
at which I rapped. Loud sounds and laughter
were heard from within.</p>

<p>A woman, whose exact age it would be difficult
to guess, so dirty and worn with age were both
herself and her dress, opened the door a very
little way.</p>

<p>Remembering the lesson of my friend with the
bootjack below, I asked, "Is M. Hhhaoushheer at
home?"</p>

<p>"Come in, and go to that door," replied the
woman, pointing to a glass-door at the end of the
apartment.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding a nauseating odour which assailed
my nostrils, and the wretched appearance
of the whole place, I resolved on following
up an adventure which promised some amusement.</p>

<p>The noise I had heard, proceeded from half-a-dozen
children, more than half naked, and extremely
dirty, who were playing and shouting.</p>

<p>The room was large, and they had it all to themselves,
for there was no furniture in it.</p>

<p>Striding over one, and pushing aside another, I
opened a glass-door, and found myself in a bedroom.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to depict this apartment, but
will leave it to the imagination of my readers, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
after the description given of the preceding room,
may easily imagine it was far from clean or comfortable.</p>

<p>No one was there to receive me. I ventured,
however, to utter once more the name of the magician
I had come to see.</p>

<p>Two curtains, which had once been white, were
suddenly drawn aside, and in the centre appeared
a gaunt-looking head, covered with a cotton nightcap,
yellow from age and long usage.</p>

<p>"What do you want, young man?" asked this
odd-looking individual, addressing me.</p>

<p>"To see M. Hausheer," I replied.</p>

<p>"I am M. Hausheer"&mdash;and my interlocutor
eyed me in a way which seemed to say&mdash;"And
what next?"</p>

<p>My illusions, so poetical a quarter of an hour
before, were, you may well believe, entirely dissipated.
M. Hausheer only inspired me with feelings
of disgust.</p>

<p>I should have liked to have departed at once;
but how could I do so? I must, at all events, say
something before retiring.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "Père Roujol has been speaking
to me about you, and of your skill in legerdemain.
From what he said, I have been induced to come
and talk to you, about an art in which I passionately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
delight; but do not disturb yourself, I will
come again another time."</p>

<p>"No, no! Wait an instant&mdash;I understand,
from what you say, you are come with the intention
of taking some lessons from me."</p>

<p>I made no reply, fearing to bind myself to an
engagement, of which I did not clearly see the end.</p>

<p>Hausheer, however, construed my silence into a
consent, and thinking, doubtless, of the money he
should gain, jumped straight out of bed. He was
partly dressed, but, without troubling himself to
put on any more clothes, he approached me.</p>

<p>"Let us see what you know, young man; what
progress have you made in the science?" said he,
offering me a pack of cards.</p>

<p>Far from accepting his invitation to give him
a proof of my abilities, I repeated my desire to
shorten my visit. But the wary professor did not
intend thus to lose his prey. That I had come to
take a lesson was evident, and he was determined
that a lesson I should have, whether I now wished
for it or not.</p>

<p>Still I persisted in my determination to retire.</p>

<p>Judging it would be wiser to persuade, than to
force me, to stay, Hausheer began to exhibit, as a
specimen of his skill, some tricks with cards, which
he performed with marvellous dexterity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
From this moment, all the apprehension and disgust
which I had previously felt, if I may so express
it, completely vanished; admiration had replaced
every other feeling. I was now as eager to remain,
as I had before been to depart.</p>

<p>It was now my turn to astonish the professor; so
I took out my celebrated snuff-box, and presenting
it to him, I touched a spring, when out flew my
little automaton, hopping, singing, and flapping his
wings; and, when all these operations were finished,
vanishing as if by enchantment.</p>

<p>As long as my bird was singing, my attention
was riveted on it, but when it had finished, I
glanced at Hausheer, to judge what effect it had
produced on him. I was struck by the covetous
expression that flashed from his eyes. It seemed
to me that he glanced furtively from side to side in
a singular manner, as if debating with himself how
he could, by any possibility, gain possession of my
snuff-box; his face was pale, and his hands, which
he stretched towards me, were tremulous with
agitation.</p>

<p>"How do you like it?" I asked him.</p>

<p>Instead of answering me, Hausheer walked across
the room to a cabinet, opened it hurriedly, and
took out something which he concealed under his
clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
"It is very pretty," said he, at length, turning
towards me; "but, I say, young man, you must
leave it with me to show to one of my friends, who
is rich, and will buy it."</p>

<p>"This box is not for sale," replied I; "it is
an order, and, indeed, I ought to take it home
to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's of no consequence. I will show it
to my friend, and you can take it home afterwards."</p>

<p>To this observation I made no reply, but wrapping
the box up in paper, I was just going to put it
back into my pocket, when Hausheer rushed up to
me, rage sparkling in his eyes.</p>

<p>I confess I felt alarmed; and my alarm was not
lessened, when my aggressor, backing me up into
a corner of the room, exclaimed, in a voice I shall
never forget, "I will have it; do you hear?"</p>

<p>At the same time he put his hand inside his
flannel waistcoat, the poor and flimsy texture of
which, permitted me to see the bony fingers of
Hausheer clutch the handle of what I supposed to
be a dagger.</p>

<p>The feeling of self-preservation restored all my
energies. The danger was imminent. I prepared
for a desperate struggle.</p>

<p>I put my snuff-box quickly into my pocket, to
leave my hands at liberty, and looked stedfastly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Hausheer, to read in his eyes, if possible, what was
to be his next move.</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment, seeming at a loss
to know what it would be best to do. It may be,
that the dogged expression of my countenance, or
perhaps the impossibility of committing a murder
without detection, made him pause; or he may have
wished to try once more, by persuasion, to gain his
ends, before proceeding to extreme measures. The
whole expression of his physiognomy underwent an
instantaneous alteration; he was evidently trying
to calm himself, and his full purple lips essayed to
form themselves into a smile.</p>

<p>"Do tell me," said he, "why you won't lend
me your snuff-box?" tapping me familiarly on the
shoulder at the same time.</p>

<p>"Devil take it, man," I replied, as calmly as my
agitated feelings would allow me, "you are so
quick, you don't give one time to explain oneself."
To this observation he uttered some gibberish, to
which I paid no attention, so much was I preoccupied
with my own thoughts. Dreading a recurrence
of his former violence, I was pondering
on some plan to escape, and was lucky enough to
hit on the <span class="locked">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Look here," I exclaimed, forcing myself to
speak in as natural a tone of voice as possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
"you are sure that you can sell this piece of
mechanism for me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Hausheer; "I am quite sure
of it, for my friend is very rich."</p>

<p>"Oh! then, if your friend is so rich, you can do
me a great service, my dear sir."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I possess a snuff-box similar to this, as regards
the mechanical part of it; but as the box itself is
of chased gold, it is too expensive an article for me
to dispose of easily. I should, therefore, be very
glad if your friend would buy it."</p>

<p>It is well said, that, to believe oneself more
clever than others, is the way to be deceived. The
cunning rascal never perceived the snare I had laid
for him.</p>

<p>"That would suit him better still," said he.
"Come, let us go, and get this treasure."</p>

<p>"Willingly," I replied. "Finish dressing yourself,
and I'll wait for you; without," I added,
"you would like to accompany me in the state you
now are?"</p>

<p>This little <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plaisanterie</i> did not provoke a smile
from Hausheer; he contented himself with offering
me a chair, and proceeded to finish his toilette.</p>

<p>During this time I was contriving the plot for
my revenge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
At length we started.</p>

<p>The Rue de l'Écu d'Or was at the back of the
Hôtel de Ville. The Rue de Vendôme au Marais,
where I lived, was not far off; besides, each of us
had reasons of his own for hastening his steps; so
we were soon there.</p>

<p>I rapped at my door, and, as soon as it was
opened, I entered in advance of my companion,
and, turning round and standing so as to prevent
his entrance, I said to him, in a calm voice, mingled
with <span class="locked">irony&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"M. Hausheer, I have some business to transact
in this house, which will detain me some time.
I hope, therefore, you will not trouble yourself to
wait for me."</p>

<p>"And the snuff-box with the bird?" said the
German, reddening with vexation.</p>

<p>"Oh! you shall have that another time," I
replied, in a mischievously significant tone of voice,
and shut the door hastily in his face.</p>

<p>As Hausheer departed, I heard him utter a perfect
volley of oaths and imprecations, amidst which,
the words, "I have been a great blockhead," were
distinctly audible.</p>

<p>These volleys of abuse mattered little to me; I
was in my own house, and had nothing to fear. I
left the rascally juggler to his anger and his regrets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Some months afterwards, I was one day reading
the "Gazette des Tribunaux," when my eye was
arrested by the name of Elias Hausheer, figuring
amongst a gang of sharpers of the worst kind.</p>

<p>The phrase, "I have been a great blockhead,"
recurred to my mind. I could now understand its
true meaning. Hausheer was not a man to stick
at trifles: he was a blockhead for not having
possessed himself of my snuff-box at <i>any price</i>.</p>

<p>The recollection of it made me shudder.</p>

<p>The knowledge of the danger I had incurred
made me more prudent for the future, but did not
prevent me from following my researches, only,
instead of going myself on such occasions, I now
always sent a third party. I employed, as my
agent, a young man whom I knew to be respectable
enough, though much of his time was passed
in "estaminets" and gaming-houses, and I paid
handsomely for each new trick that he brought me.</p>

<p>At such a statement I fancy I hear my reader
exclaim: "Why pay so much for learning a thing
which is wrong? Is it not the act of a fool or a
monomaniac?"</p>

<p>I acknowledge my weakness; but, dear reader,
had it not been for this monomania, I should never
have had the success I have enjoyed.</p>

<p>I always intended turning my knowledge to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
good account; many circumstances have retarded
the fulfilment of my intentions; but at length I
have the honour of presenting the result of my

<p class="hangcenter">Origin of the name "Greek"&mdash;The first gambling-houses&mdash;Invention
of roulette&mdash;Hunt for dupes&mdash;Opening of "<i>tripots</i>," or low gambling-houses&mdash;The
Greek described&mdash;Different classes of sharpers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let me in the first place explain to my readers,
why the compatriots of Homer and Plato have been
thus honoured, or rather dishonoured, and how it
comes that the word "Greek" has, in our day,
become synonymous with rascal or knave.</p>

<p>The following are the <span class="locked">facts:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Towards the end of the reign of Louis XIV., a
certain Chevalier of Greek origin, named Apoulos,
was admitted into the Court circle, where he played
with such success, and won so largely, that suspicions
were aroused as to the fairness of his play.</p>

<p>His dexterity was astonishing; but one day he
was taken "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">flagrante delicto</i>," and condemned to
the galleys for a period of twenty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
The circumstance made a great noise at the time,
and, ever since, similar rogues have been termed
"Greeks."</p>

<p>Shakspeare asks, "What's in a name?" There
is, however, a French proverb which tells us that,
"<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Souvent ce sont les noms qui décident des choses</i>."
Many who did not object to be called "Greeks,"
would have loathed the name of "swindler."</p>

<p>The number of these light-fingered gentry was
greatly increased, by the establishment in Paris of
two public gambling houses, known as the Hôtel
de Gèvres, and Hôtel de Soissons.</p>

<p>Until then, the Greeks exercised their vocation
separately; most of them had no arranged method
of proceeding, and their tricks were nearly all
badly executed.</p>

<p>In fact, the art of cheating was still in its infancy.</p>

<p>The opening of the two hotels above mentioned,
caused a complete revolution amongst the Greeks.
The cleverest amongst them met, invented new
manœuvres, and clubbed together to cheat their
neighbours; they imagined, calculated, and invented,
all sorts of tricks until then unknown.</p>

<p>Lansquenet, Pharo, Piquet, and Quadrille were
the favourite games of that period, and being much
in vogue, were golden mines of wealth to these
rascals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
The game of roulette, even, which had just been
introduced into the fashionable hells, and which
the public believed they could play without fear,
was tampered with by this fraternity.</p>

<p>One of them, who was a geometrician, had a
roulette board made, in which the black divisions
were larger than the white ones, so that the chance
of the ball entering the latter was <span class="locked">diminished.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a></span></p>

<p>To arrange all this, it was necessary to have an
understanding with the attendants at these hells;
but this was not difficult, as most of them were
scamps.</p>

<p>The number of Greeks in Paris increased at
length to such an extent, that they were at a loss
for dupes.</p>

<p>This state of things, however, did not last long.
Reckoning on the weakness of human nature, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
men knew, that the number of dupes in the world
is without limit, and that they will never fail you, if
you only know how to profit by the weakness of
the human heart.</p>

<p>They organised a band of emissaries or agents,
whom they despatched in all directions, to discover
and attract&mdash;1st, All strangers newly arrived in
the capital; 2nd, Barristers coming out of court
after having gained a suit; 3rd, Successful
gamblers who had won to a large amount; 4th,
Heirs to large estates; 5th, Imprudent clerks
and foolish youths, who would stake their last
farthing.</p>

<p>With such auxiliaries, the Greeks again realised
immense profits; but their doings created so much
scandal, that upon a representation made by the
police, Louis XV. ordered both the Hôtels de
Gèvres and de Soissons to be closed, and renewed
the former stringent regulations against all games
of chance.</p>

<p>Even this measure did not disconcert the Greeks;
they opened low gambling-houses, and played in
secret.</p>

<p>The police were again put on their track, and
waged fearful war against them.</p>

<p>Constant trials, imprisonment of proprietors, and
the conviction of a host of swindlers, alarmed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
dupes, whose fears began to be awakened, so
that they dared no longer frequent these establishments.</p>

<p>Thus followed and routed, the Greeks dispersed
in all directions, rushed into the provinces and
foreign countries, to return, after a time, to their
former home in the capital; when the Government,
in urgent want of money, established Frascati, and
the rival houses in the Palais Royal. Over the
doors of these institutions ought to have been inscribed
"<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ici on trompe de bonne foi</i>," or in other
words, "Here they <i>take in</i> all comers."</p>

<p>The enormous sums lost by the public, all the
chances of which had beforehand been cleverly
calculated, produced an immense revenue to the
State, and considerable profits to the owners of the
tables.</p>

<p>The Government shut its eyes to these knavish
proceedings, until forced to take notice of them by
the clamours of the public, who would not submit
to be thus openly robbed.</p>

<p>Roulette and other gambling games were again
prohibited, and, with them, the whole gang of
sharpers for whom these games had always been a
centre of attraction, appeared also to vanish. I
say the gang <i>seemed</i> to vanish, for, if roulette has
been banished from France, the Greeks have unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
by no means ceased to reside there.
But where are they to be found?</p>

<p>Their numerous dupes know too well. They
have learnt to their cost, that these insatiable birds
of prey are always to be found wherever there is
money to be got.</p>

<p>But you will ask, "How are they to be recognised?"</p>

<p>There is the difficulty; for these heroes of the
criminal courts are now become more clever than
ever. Forced to mix in society, they know the
necessity of being perfect in their unlawful occupation,
in order to escape the punishment which
the law has in store for them.</p>

<p>However difficult it is to recognise them, we
will endeavour to point them out to all honest men;
so that they may know them, if not by their faces,
at least by some characteristic signs, but especially
by a revelation of the tricks to which these men
usually have recourse.</p>

<p>Taken collectively, the "Greeks" present no
peculiarity of type. It would be difficult to
sketch their features, so numerous and varied are
they. I think it best, therefore, to characterise
them by dividing them into three categories.</p>

<p>1st. The aristocratic Greek, or sharper of the
fashionable world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
2nd. The Greek of the middle classes.</p>

<p>3rd. The Greek of the low gambling houses.</p>

<p>"Honour to whom honour is due;" so let us
begin with the first on our list.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE GREEK OF FASHIONABLE LIFE.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Wonderful acuteness&mdash;Refined sleight-of-hand&mdash;Delicacy of touch.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sharper of fashionable life is, without doubt,
the most adroit and clever in his villany; he is,
one may say, grand master of the art of cheating.</p>

<p>He is generally a man of the world, whose dress
and manners leave nothing to be desired. If he
does not dazzle by the brilliancy of his conversation,
it is that he does not wish to eclipse others,
but perhaps reserves his forces for the "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mise en
scène</i>" of his villanies.</p>

<p>This "citizen of Athens" cares little to please
in general society, but emulates only those qualities
which may be of use to him in his profession;
and whether he is thus gifted by nature, or has
acquired the science by study, certain it is, that he
has that delicacy of perception, exquisite tact, and
above all, that marvellous talent of appreciation of
character, of which I have already spoken in my
work, "Confessions of a Wizard." When he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
victimising his dupes, his eyes, seemingly fixed on
his own cards, are casting furtive glances to see
all that is passing around him. He knows, by the
effect produced on his adversary's countenance,
when the cards are turned up, as well as by the
classification of the cards themselves, the nature
of his play.</p>

<p>As a physiognomist, the Greek of fashionable
life rivals the cleverest disciple of Lavater. It
would be in vain to try and baffle him, by putting
on a dull and stolid expression of countenance; the
slightest movement of the nerves of the face, or an
almost imperceptible contraction of the features,
discovers to him your most hidden thoughts.</p>

<p>This quickness of perception is equally useful to
him, in discovering if he is looked on with doubt
or suspicion.</p>

<p>The aristocratic "Greek" is also an adept in
every sort of gambling. The theories and probabilities
of all games of chance, so cleverly described
by Van Tenac, are the principles on which
he bases his system, and which he makes use of
with wonderful intelligence.</p>

<p>To this rare talent, the aristocratic Greek unites
a profound knowledge of the most refined sleight
of hand; thus, no one knows better than he, how
to change one card for another, make a false cut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
to abstract or add a trick, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and he has
carried these three important principles of cheating
to a marvellous perfection.</p>

<p>Blessed with excellent eyesight, he can, after
a few deals, and attentively watching the cards,
recognise many of them. One is perhaps the
slightest shade more highly coloured than the rest.
Another has on some particular part a spot or
blemish, an imperfection of some kind, that the
best manufacturers cannot always avoid, of which
he takes advantage.</p>

<p>In the absence of any mark, by his extreme
delicacy of touch, he will be enabled to distinguish
different cards as they pass through his
hands, aided by a slight indentation which he
makes on them with his nail. Once able to
distinguish them, he can either give them to his
adversary, or appropriate them to himself, whichever
he deems most favourable to his interests.</p>

<p>The aristocratic Greek always quits the capital
during the summer months, and frequents the
various watering-places. He invariably directs
his steps towards that celebrated and brilliant
oasis, which will surely some day bear the appellation
of <span class="locked">Villa-Benazet,<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></span> but which at present is
called Baden-Baden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
It is there, thanks to the blindness and wealth
of his adversaries, that he realises enormous profits,
by means of which he lives like a nabob.</p>

<p>The greatest number, however, of these fashionable
sharpers, end their days in misery. Some few
retire into private life; there to live an existence
of fear and remorse, so well depicted by a witty
moralist and member of the <span class="locked">Academy,<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a></span> in his book
entitled "Une Fortune mystérieuse."</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GREEK OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hangcenter">The "<i>Comtois</i>" and "<i>Amazones</i>"&mdash;Tricks and frauds&mdash;An heir expectant&mdash;Game
at bouillotte&mdash;A rich pocket-book&mdash;The bill to pay&mdash;Dupers
duped.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Greek of the middle classes, otherwise
termed the nomad Greek, on account of his ubiquity,
is a sort of chain or link between the aristocratic
sharper, and him of the low gambling houses.
This chain is of great length, and unites, by almost
imperceptible gradations, the two extremes in this
world of filibusters.</p>

<p>The nomad Greek seldom works alone, he is
in league with accomplices called "comtois."</p>

<p>These are for the most part other Greeks, whose
reputation is higher than that of their associates.
But, according to circumstances, these respectable
individuals take it by turns to play the role of
"comtois."</p>

<p>These gentlemen, besides their accomplices,
have female assistants called "Amazones."</p>

<p>These women are, for the most part, very pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
and attractive, and are equally, if not more, vicious
than their lords and masters.</p>

<p>In those attractive snares to the unwary and to
foreigners, known under the name of clubs, these
"Amazones" perform the office of decoys.</p>

<p>The wiles and tricks of these women will not
bear analysis, and could not be described here.
Suffice it to say, that, like the simple larks which a
fowler attracts and blinds by means of a revolving
mirror, the imprudent and unwary visitors, fascinated
by the seductions of these sirens, become
an easy prey, and stupidly allow themselves to be
plucked by the hunters of these prairies.</p>

<p>The nomad Greek cannot boast of the wit and
good manners of his colleague of the fashionable
world, neither has he that finesse in executing his
tricks, which renders detection difficult. But he
is not the less clever in the manipulation of the
different means of cheating.</p>

<p>Cards, dice, and dominoes, are all, in his
hands, most formidable instruments of his profession.</p>

<p>He is able to exercise his adroitness at all games,
simple or complicated, be it whist or battle, tric-trac,
or even "heads or tails." He knows tricks,
with which he can turn each and all of these to
his advantage. His dupes are as numerous as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
are varied; he finds them anywhere and everywhere.
He spares none; his nearest relatives, his most
intimate friends, are often his first victims.</p>

<p>The following anecdote proves the perfidy of
this class of <span class="locked">sharper:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Three Greeks, united, not by the bonds of friendship,
but of rascality, went each on his way to seek
for dupes.</p>

<p>One of them, a young Italian, nicknamed Candour,
perhaps on account of his craft and cunning,
informed his companions, that he had become
acquainted with a young man of position, just
arrived from the country.</p>

<p>This young provincial was rich, a gambler, and
prodigal to excess,&mdash;qualities much appreciated by
the three rascals.</p>

<p>Finding out from the Italian, that his new friend
was to be at the opera that same night, they immediately
arranged their plan of attack.</p>

<p>So good an opportunity was not to be lost, and
when their plans were all settled, they separated,
having arranged to meet at the opera-house.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour, the three Greeks met
in the lobby of the theatre, and were fortunate
enough to see the young capitalist soon afterwards.</p>

<p>The Italian, having addressed his new friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
introduced him to his two associates, giving them
titles borrowed from the nobility.</p>

<p>The introduction over, the conversation became
general, and so interesting, that their victim did
not quit their side the whole evening.</p>

<p>The three Greeks were most affable in their
manners towards the young man, and he, delighted
with his new acquaintances, invited them all to
sup with him at the celebrated restaurant of the
"Maison Dorée."</p>

<p>The invitation, it may easily be divined, was
accepted with pleasure.</p>

<p>The repast was worthy of the host.</p>

<p>No expense was spared to regale such charming
companions.</p>

<p>To prolong the pleasure of this charming <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">réunion</i>,
one of them began talking of play, and bouillotte
being proposed, was received with acclamation.</p>

<p>Whilst they were laying out the card-table, the
three Greeks again managed to have a little private
conversation, and, by the advice of Candour, they
agreed, that, in order to allay all suspicions in the
mind of their victim, it would be better to allow
him to win at first to the extent of three thousand
francs (120<i>l.</i>), after which they would fleece him
without remorse.</p>

<p>The game began well for the Greeks: the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
man placed on the table a pocket-book which
seemed well-filled, and took out of it a note for
five hundred francs (20<i>l.</i>), which he staked.</p>

<p>Fortune, by the assistance of the three sharpers,
seemed to smile on the provincial, and in a short
time, he found himself possessor of the sum it had
been agreed he should be allowed to gain.</p>

<p>"Indeed, gentlemen," exclaimed he, putting the
notes he had just won into his pocket-book, "I
am so overcome at such a wonderful run of luck,
that I will go on playing, to give you the chance,
at least, of winning back your money. I am determined
I will not stake less now than a thousand
francs (40<i>l.</i>)."</p>

<p>Scarcely had he uttered these words, when, drawing
his handkerchief from his pocket, the young
man held it up to his nose, which began to bleed
violently.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen," said he, "I
will be with you again in five minutes, I am very
subject to these hemorrhages from the nose;" and
he went out, leaving his pocket-book on the table.
Candour, filled with compassionate interest, rushed
after his friend; but truth compels us to state, not
to give him assistance, but to bolt with him as fast
as his legs could carry him.</p>

<p>The rich provincial was neither more nor less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
a Parisian sharper, with whom Candour had concocted
a scheme, to rob his accomplices of three
thousand francs.</p>

<p>The hemorrhage, and the pocket-handkerchief
stained with blood, were the dénoûement of the
comedy, the first act of which took place in the
Opera-House.</p>

<p>Let us now return to the restaurant, to see and
hear what is taking place there.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Patoche (one of the rascals who
remained behind) to his comrade, eyeing at the same
time the pocket-book full of bank-notes lying on
the table, "all proceeds beyond our hopes. Let us
imagine we have gained the bank-notes from the
provincial. Let's pay ourselves, and be off."</p>

<p>"Yes; but," said the other, "you forget, the
bill must be settled before we can go."</p>

<p>"<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i> What a fool you are! We will
pay the bill, and the pocket-book will reimburse us
for any money we advance."</p>

<p>"And if we should meet the owner of it!"</p>

<p>"Well, what could he say to us? We were on
our way to meet him, to return him the pocket-book,
which he left on the table."</p>

<p>"True; I understand; he will owe us many
thanks for so doing. It's a good idea."</p>

<p>The two rogues then asked for the bill, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
they settled, gave the waiter a handsome fee, and
hastened down-stairs.</p>

<p>As soon as they reached the bottom of the staircase,
the one who had the pocket-book in his
possession stopped short.</p>

<p>"I say, Patoche, a thought has just struck me.
Go back, and tell the waiters, that we intend going
to the Café Riche to continue our game. This
will give us time to escape to some place of safety
with our prize."</p>

<p>No sooner had Patoche departed up the stairs
to execute his errand, than his companion vanished
with the pocket-book.</p>

<p>Which of these two rogues was the most deceived?</p>

<p>The pocket-book was full of waste paper: the
bank-notes had been cleverly abstracted by the
pretended provincial.</p>

<p>This sketch will give some idea of the characters
of the individuals whom I herein portray. If my
readers wish for further information, they must
continue the perusal of this work, and the different
rogueries herein described, amongst which the
nomad Greek plays some of the principal <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôles</i>;
I think they will then have a clear view of the
villany of these men.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GREEK OF THE TRIPOT.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">His abject condition&mdash;The public-house&mdash;Pretended stupidity&mdash;Dupes
fleeced&mdash;Acting the countryman&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Table d'hôte</i>&mdash;The pellets&mdash;A
good farce&mdash;Deception&mdash;The three cards&mdash;The countryman's bet&mdash;Clever
substitution&mdash;English rogues&mdash;Thimble-rig.</p></blockquote>

<p>It may with truth be said, that the Greek of
low life is a sort of vulgar imitation of the two
other types that I have just been describing, and, if
I may be allowed to draw the comparison, I should
say, that the Greek of the low gambling-house, is,
to his more favoured comrade, what a street-ballad
singer is to an educated artiste.</p>

<p>Heaven forbid that I should fall into an ecstasy
about the villanies of any sharper, let him be of
whatever class he may; but I may venture to say,
that, although under no circumstances should I like
to be robbed, yet, if I am to be so, I should much
prefer being cheated out of my money by a gentlemanlike
scamp, than by a low vulgar sharper.</p>

<p>As regards elegance of manners and appearance,
there can be no comparison between the aristocratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Greek, and him of the lowest grade. There is
every reason to believe, that the former is not even
aware of the existence of the latter. Men of this
stamp all resemble each other more or less; most of
them are miserable specimens of humanity, whom
idleness and debauchery have reduced to the necessity
of cheating, hoping thereby to get what honest
labour had failed to obtain for them.</p>

<p>Their tricks are usually as coarse, as the victims
on whom they practise. It is no longer sleight of
hand, it is a sort of cheating, for which there is no
name. Their victims being ordinarily so easy to
dupe, they do not care to become more expert.</p>

<p>Besides, it is generally not until after finishing
the fifth or sixth bottle, that the play begins.</p>

<p>The qualities most essential for these rascals,
are to be able to drink and smoke to any extent,
without being affected by it. The constant use of
spirits produces this insensibility to their influence.</p>

<p>The third-rate sharper makes the lower public-houses
and tap-rooms, outside the barriers, the
scene of his exploits. His victims are drunken
labourers, countrymen visiting the capital, soldiers
on leave, and sometimes persons of small independent
means out for a frolic.</p>

<p>This style of Greek has usually a colleague to
assist him in his manœuvres. Their operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
require the assistance of a second party, as they are
performed American fashion.</p>

<p>I cite one out of a thousand similar <span class="locked">instances:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The swindler enters a public-house, which he
knows is much frequented, and places himself at a
table, near which another man is already seated;
this man, whom he pretends not to know, is an
accomplice. He calls for a bottle of wine, which
he empties at once, and begins talking to his
neighbour in a loud voice, so as to attract the
attention of the whole company. He puts on an
appearance of the greatest stupidity, and makes
some foolish remarks arranged for the occasion, to
which the "<i>comtois</i>" replies by making game of
him, to the great amusement and satisfaction of his
auditory.</p>

<p>Insensibly all draw near, and approach the two
antagonists.</p>

<p>The Greek ends by getting annoyed with the
joking of his neighbour, and proposes to play for
the two bottles on the table.</p>

<p>The proposition is accepted, but the Greek plays
badly, and the game is soon lost. He holds his
cards so awkwardly, that it appears as if he had
never had one in his hands before. His defeat was
evident from the first.</p>

<p>His fortunate adversary, delighted with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
triumph, wins everything, and quickly walks
off.</p>

<p>The rogue who remains behind, bitterly bewails
his loss, and testifies his anxiety to take his revenge
on the first comer.</p>

<p>The dupes, led on by the hope of winning easily,
are all eager to accept the challenge. They play,
and win as they expected, but the rascal, far from
being discouraged, takes from his pocket a handful
of five-franc pieces, which he announces he is ready
to stake, to try and regain what he has lost.</p>

<p>This declaration, together with the clink of the
silver, is too great a temptation to withstand.
Every one present is anxious to have his share of
a booty so easy to acquire. They play again, and
again win several games, and this additional loss
(arranged by the Greek) gives him an opportunity
of raising his stakes and offering to play double or
quits.</p>

<p>Now begins the real game of our hero, who,
without forgetting his character of the fool, brings
into play the resources of a coarse sort of sleight
of hand. He gains with an air of such stupid
simplicity and "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gaucherie</i>," that no one has the
slightest suspicion on the subject. Luck has
turned in his favour, and, in the parlance of
"<i>cabarets</i>," there is a Providence over drunkards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
The Greek, after having filled his purse at the
expense of his adversaries, retires for want of combatants,
and goes off to share the spoil of the day
with his associate.</p>

<p>This scene is, in the vocabulary of Greeks,
termed; "acting the countryman."</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Were a case of sharping of this description tried
before the tribunals of justice, one, or at most two
culprits, would be brought forward; and yet is it
not evident to every one, that, in robberies conducted
American fashion, and particularly in those
of the kind specified above, the duped are as guilty
as the dupers? Would they not have taken advantage
of the poor foolish countryman to victimise him?
The sole reason which prevented them so doing,
was the fact of their having met with one, who,
with all his apparent stupidity, was more than a
match for themselves.</p>

<p>If I were writing for the "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">habitués</i>" of Paul
Niquet and the frequenters of "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Père la Rangaine</i>"<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a>
I should make the Greek of the public-houses the
hero of this work; but as I have every reason to
believe, that most of my readers will never come in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
contact with this class of sharper, I shall only
mention one or two of his best tricks, and then have
done with him.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We will suppose our hero to be dining at one
of the "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tables-d'hôte</i>" outside the barriers, where
you get your dinner at a shilling a head. In the
course of the repast, the Greek, who, by-the-bye,
seems a jovial sort of fellow, offers to make all sorts
of bets with those around him,&mdash;bets of that
equivocal nature in which the proposer is sure to
win.</p>

<p>The Greek, however, makes these bets less with
a view of gain, than to irritate the men who lose,
and from whom he hopes later in the evening to
derive some benefit.</p>

<p>At dessert he takes three plates and some
tumblers, and affects to play a juggling trick with
pellets of bread crumbs.</p>

<p>But his performances are so ridiculously "<i>maladroit</i>,"
that the spectators only laugh at him.</p>

<p>There is no deception, for, as they say, one sees
the string which makes the puppet dance.</p>

<p>Still the Greek goes on with wonderful <span class="locked">assurance:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he observes, "you see I put this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
little ball under a plate; well, I will make it disappear
without your seeing anything;&mdash;I mean, that
the most clever amongst you will see nothing."</p>

<p>But whilst the Greek is placing the pellet under
the plate, he knows well enough, that by a particular
motion of his hand, he has sent it rolling on
the floor.</p>

<p>Pretending to think that it is still under the
plate, he endeavours to explain what a clever trick
he is about to show them, as he does not even
require to approach the table to do it. Whilst
giving these explanations, he affects to turn his
back to the spot where the trick is to be executed.</p>

<p>A spectator, who has seen the pellet fall down on
the ground, picks it up, and puts it openly in his
pocket, at the same time addressing his neighbours
in a low <span class="locked">voice:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Let us play him a good trick, and bet with
him, that the pellet is no longer under the plate.
He'll be sure to take the bet, as he is not aware
of his own awkwardness."</p>

<p>They agree to the proposition the more eagerly,
as they are all pleased to mystify the mystifier, who,
far from declining, bets a large sum, and offers,
moreover, to bet it with each spectator individually
who likes to accept the challenge.</p>

<p>Two or three people come forward, and first and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
foremost are those who have been already taken in.
They rub their hands in glee with hopes of being
revenged, and feel sure of winning, as they know
that the pellet is in the pocket of one of the
betters.</p>

<p>But, alas! they are all deceived. When the
plate is raised, behold! The pellet is there,
under it.</p>

<p>The juggler has won his bets.</p>

<p>Whilst throwing one pellet on the ground, the
cunning fellow had very cleverly introduced another
under the plate.</p>

<p>The spectator who so eagerly offered to bet was
his colleague.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Again, here is another instance of the adroitness
of these miscreants.</p>

<p>Some years since, on the road between the
"Place de la Bastille" and the "Jardin des
Plantes," or any other public thoroughfare where
the Parisian cockneys were likely to be met with, a
man was to be seen on his knees on the pavement,
which he had appropriated to himself, to show off
the following piece of deception.</p>

<p>He held in his hands three cards&mdash;say, the seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
of hearts, the king of spades, and the ace of
diamonds.</p>

<p>The two last of these cards were held in his
right hand, the first-mentioned in his left, as is
shown in the following engraving.</p>

<div id="ip_41" class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;"><img src="images/i_b_041.jpg" width="410" height="269" alt="" /></div>

<p>The rogue, raising his hands a little, requested
them to remark the order in which the cards were
placed. Then turning them over, he threw them,
one after another, side by side on the pavement.</p>

<p>The seven of hearts is designated by the
figure 1;</p>

<p>The king of spades by No. 2;</p>

<p>And the ace by No. 3.</p>

<p>This done, he shuffled the cards for some time,
to draw off the attention of the spectators.</p>

<p>Addressing one of them, he asked him where
the king was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
They, having seen the card in his right hand, and
followed it closely with their eyes, point it out
each time, and are never deceived.</p>

<p>The Greek pretended to be much annoyed at
not being able to baffle the spectators.</p>

<p>He began again, and this time offered to make a
large bet, that they would not find the card.</p>

<p>The people laughed, but did not venture to take
his bet, when one amongst them, braver than the
rest, a sort of country clown (to all appearance),
stepped forward.</p>

<p>"That's capital," said he, with an oath, "I bet
you twenty sous I guess where the king is."</p>

<p>The bet was accepted by the Greek who, turning
over the card pointed out by the countryman,
confessed he had lost, and paid the stake.</p>

<p>The two champions continued to bet, and the
Greek invariably lost, until the peasant, satisfied
with his winnings, retired. The rest of the spectators,
who had stood quietly looking on, were
thoroughly taken in by the countryman.</p>

<p>When he had retired, and the Greek continuing
his offers of betting, three or four of
them, taking the man for a fool, accepted the
challenge.</p>

<p>But they, poor dupes, were ignorant that the
countryman was an accomplice, and that the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
he had pretended to gain, was only a lure to excite
their cupidity.</p>

<p>With the fresh set of people anxious to bet, the
Greek entirely changed his tactics. In throwing
the cards on the ground, he, by a manœuvre, completely
changed their position.</p>

<p>Thus, it is true, he placed the seven of hearts on
No. 1, but, instead of letting fall the king of spades
on No. 2, he slipped the card above (the ace of
diamonds) in its place, and put the king on No. 3.</p>

<p>This substitution was so rapidly done, that no
one perceived it, and of course, when the shuffling
was all over, and the card named by the lookers
on was turned up, it proved to be the ace of
diamonds.</p>

<p>As this occurred very often, the losers determined
to try and take their revenge, seldom
quitting until they were all cleared out.</p>

<p>It sometimes happened that quarrels and even
pitched battles followed this system of cheating; in
which case the accomplice, who, from a distance, had
watched the proceedings, interposed his powerful aid,
and assisted his comrade to decamp.</p>

<p>This sort of gambling is now only met with in
public-houses, as the police have interdicted the
exhibition of it on the public thoroughfares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In England they have a game similar to this,
called Thimble-rig. Three thimbles are placed on
a table, like the goblets used in jugglery.</p>

<p>A small ball is put under one of them; the
thimbles are then moved about rapidly, so as to
bewilder the spectators. And, as in the previous
trick, the rogue has an accomplice to aid him in
obtaining bets from the spectators, and, as has also
been shown, he is sure to win.</p>

<p>But with the public it is quite another thing; the
rogue himself never loses, for in pushing about the
thimbles he artfully manages to make the ball pass
from under the thimble, where he placed it, to
another.</p>

<p>This is done by an act of sleight of hand.</p>

<p>From what I have said, it will be evident to the
reader that, though the Greek of the low gambling-house
is, to a certain extent, different from his
brother sharpers, still he resembles them in their
rogueries and cheating.</p>

<span class="subhead">A GREEK TAKEN IN THE FACT.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hangcenter">The restaurant of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Veau qui tête</i>&mdash;Subscription ball&mdash;The card room&mdash;A
lucky player&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sauter la coupe</i>&mdash;Mystification&mdash;The tell-tale
hat&mdash;We are done.</p></blockquote>

<p>With such a number of Greeks mixing in
society, one is tempted to ask, how is it that
they are so seldom brought before the tribunals
of justice?</p>

<p>This is easy to explain. In the first place, the
Greek is generally clever, cunning, artful, and
circumspect; for these reasons, his manœuvres
are seldom discovered.</p>

<p>And, supposing he were caught in the very act
of cheating, if it were in a private house, they
would probably be content with making him disgorge
his ill-gotten gains, and ignominiously turning
him out of the house.</p>

<p>If it were in public, the swindler always knows
how to manage the affair in some way or another,
or to bolt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
The following circumstance I was myself a
witness of.</p>

<p>There was formerly (I speak of thirty years ago),
on the Place du Châtelet, on the spot now
occupied by the Chambre des Notaires, a very
large restaurant of great repute, known as the
"Veau qui tête" ("Sucking Calf").</p>

<p>In the centre of this vast edifice was a picture
representing a pastoral subject&mdash;it was a cow
suckling her calf. This very primitive allegory
was meant to express, that the food supplied in
that house, was of the most harmless and nutritive
description.</p>

<p>And it was perfectly true, that, whether it was a
small entertainment for one or two people, or a grand
wedding dinner, the table was always well served,
and there were large rooms to make merry in.</p>

<p>This matter <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">posé</i> (as the professors of physiology
say), I will proceed with my recital.</p>

<p>During the Carnival of 1832, some folks of my
acquaintance took it into their heads to give a
subscription ball, and selected the famous saloons
of the "Veau qui tête" to give it in.</p>

<p>The subscribers were numerous, and consequently,
as often happens, the society was of a
mixed character. Out of three hundred persons
present, scarcely a dozen knew each other. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
as there were plenty of police, people were not
afraid to join in the dance.</p>

<p>Wherever there is a ball, there is generally a
room for play. In this instance, close to the ballroom,
was a saloon filled with tables for play, and
gambling going on.</p>

<p>I was one of the players.</p>

<p>I am not a gambler, for I play with great
caution and moderation. I never risk more than
a small piece of silver at cards, and only play,
until the sum I intend to venture is lost; after
which I retire, if not with pleasure, at least with
philosophic resignation.</p>

<p>On this evening, Dame Fortune was against me,
and in spite of my best strategetical calculations,
the inconstant goddess had quickly put me <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors
de combat</i>. The last of the ten francs I had
staked had vanished.</p>

<p>The lightness of my purse left me in a capital
physical condition to dance; but, though I had
never been a great dancer, I feared, in spite of my
philosophy, that my partners might perceive that I
was out of sorts. I am obliged to confess, that at
that period of my life, ten francs was a large sum
for me to lose.</p>

<p>But at twenty-five years of age one is seldom a
millionnaire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Therefore, instead of joining in the dance, I
directed my steps to another table where they
were playing, with a malicious intention of consoling
myself, by looking on at the misfortunes
of others. One does feel so spiteful when one is
vexed.</p>

<p>The game was very animated, gold was glittering
on the table, and all eyes, riveted on the precious
metal, seemed eager with anticipated pleasure.</p>

<p>They were playing écarté.</p>

<p>The player, behind whom I stood, was most
unfortunate; he had lost four games one after
another.</p>

<p>I began to think that I had brought my ill-luck
to my neighbour. Wishing to be strictly
impartial, I resolved to make him some amends,
by transporting it and myself to the side of his
adversary.</p>

<p>The man behind whom I now placed myself,
was about forty years of age. He had a frank,
open countenance, and boasted a huge pair of
thick "blondes moustaches." He wore a blue
coat, buttoned up to the throat, which gave
him a military air; this, together with his
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">distinguée</i> appearance, and easy, gentlemanlike
manners, betokened a man accustomed to the best
society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
He was most fortunate in his play, and after
each game, invariably, whilst collecting and dealing
the cards, kept alluding to his wonderful luck, as if
he wished to justify himself to his opponent.</p>

<p>"If," said he, addressing his adversary, "you
had, unluckily for me, played a diamond instead of
a spade, I should have been forced to take it, and
you would have made the trick."</p>

<p>This manner of particularising facts rather
astonished me. I was at this time <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au fait</i> at
some of the tricks of the Greeks, and their
way of discoursing on the game. It also struck
me that I perceived him making certain passes, to
which I was no stranger.</p>

<p>I stood for some time looking on, with the
greatest attention, thinking I might be deceived
in my conjectures. The game was played with
the most perfect regularity. However, I allowed
no movement of his to escape me.</p>

<p>In the end, my minute and determined investigation
met with the success it deserved. A false
move which he made, put me on the scent, and I
now felt sure that the fortunate winner was nothing
more than a Greek of the first water.</p>

<p>I confess with shame, that once in possession of
the secret of these manœuvres, I took the greatest
delight in seeing them executed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Under the pretext of ascertaining the truth of
my suspicions, I made friends with my conscience,
and indulged in a spectacle truly interesting to me.</p>

<p>It was charming to observe my hero, with his
elegant address, collecting the cards, sorting them,
and selecting those which he thought would be
of use to him. Then classing them in the most
natural manner, and at length cutting them for
his own benefit, before the eyes of a whole host
of spectators.</p>

<p>Poor dupes, I pitied them.</p>

<p>In the end, my feelings became more worthy of
me, and I returned to my better self. Laying
aside my admiration, I resolved to put a stop to
the continued success of the elegant sharper.</p>

<p>In consequence of this determination, I went
up to one of our commissaries of police, named
Brissard, whom I knew was intelligent and energetic.
I told him what I had seen.</p>

<p>Brissard followed me&mdash;waited until the individual
I pointed out to him rose from the table (a
Greek is not imprudent enough to go on winning
the whole evening), and when, after being
successful eight consecutive times, he ceded his
place, my friend addressed him without further
circumlocution.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, "I am one of the police in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
attendance. I have not the honour of knowing
you. May I ask who introduced you here?"</p>

<p>"Oh! certainly," replied the Greek, with
great assurance, a benevolent smile playing on his
features. "I was introduced by my friend
M&mdash;&mdash;" (at the same time mentioning a well-known
name), "to one of your colleagues, who
gave me a most favourable reception. However,
sir, if you will come with me, we will go and find
my friend, who will confirm what I have stated.
Stay, I think he is on this side the room."</p>

<p>Startled at the frankness of this reply, Brissard,
thinking that I must have been mistaken,
was on the point of apologising, but on a sign
from me, he followed the Greek, who led the way,
and appeared to be searching for his friend in
every direction.</p>

<p>The crowd was so great we had great difficulty
in following him.</p>

<p>All at once, the blue coat disappeared, as if by
enchantment. In vain did we look for him in the
room. We soon found that our man, in passing
near the door, had slipped out.</p>

<p>"I'll catch him yet," said Brissard, running
towards the cloak room, "the fugitive must be
bare-headed, he has not had time to get his hat.
The address of his hatter may help us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
"Madame," asked he, addressing the woman in
charge of the hats and cloaks, "has a gentleman
with large moustachios just been here to get his
hat?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"That will do. Take great care of the last hat
which is not claimed, and keep it for me."</p>

<p>He then went on to the <i>concierge</i>.</p>

<p>"Tell me, have you just seen any one go out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; a tall man, with big moustachios."</p>

<p>"That's he; and he was bare-headed?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but after going a few steps, he pulled out
an opera hat from under his coat, and put it on his
head."</p>

<p>"The rascal had made his arrangements beforehand,"
said Brissard. "We are done."</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>If I had continued to frequent these kinds of
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">réunions</i>, I should have acquired a certain dexterity
in this sort of rogue-hunting; but about this time,
several circumstances occurred, which turned my
thoughts from all worldly pleasures. On the other
hand, it was repugnant to my feelings, even though
it amused me, to spend my time in pursuits,
which, though very useful, are scarcely considered
honourable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
I have related the story of the Greek and his
hat, because it serves as a sort of introduction to a
series of facts descriptive of the art of cheating.</p>

<p>In continuing my story, we must allow for a
lapse of twenty years.</p>

<p>In 1852, after a long series of performances,
which I had been giving in Germany, I stopped at
that charming little place, Spa, with the double
intention of giving a few entertainments there, and
also of getting a little rest after my fatiguing tour.</p>

<p>I put up at an hotel, the name of which has
escaped me. It is very ungrateful of me, for it
was an hotel where you received the greatest
civility and attention, and the table was excellent,
which is what one does not always meet with in
one's travels.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">table d'hôte</i> was usually very gay, as the
people composing it were the <i>élite</i> of society, all in
perfect health, coming there nominally to drink the
waters, but in reality for amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
My neighbour at table was an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">habitué</i> of the
house, who had been living there, it was said, for
some months.</p>

<p>He was an old man, with a long white beard,
which was so thick and bushy that it nearly covered
his face. The only part visible was a pair of cheeks,
the roseate hue of which might cause a sigh of
envy in the heart of many a coquette. One might
compare them to two rosy apples lying on a bed of
snow.</p>

<p>M. Raymond, for such was the appellation of the
gentleman in question, was one of the most intelligent
and amusing companions it was possible to
meet with.</p>

<p>In conversation, he possessed the rare art of
drawing others out, that is to say, having himself
something interesting to relate, which often was the
case, he managed, by cleverly turning the conversation,
to obtain from each of the party assembled,
his quota towards the general gaiety. He was, in
fact, the life and soul of our gastronomic <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">réunions</i>.</p>

<p>M. Raymond, who was sometimes called "Voisin
Raymond," or simply "Mon Voisin," seemed to
be well off. The extent of his fortune was unknown,
but he must have had some means, as he was one
of the most constant players at the roulette-table;
and to play much at this game one must be rich,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Roulette is not a winning game&mdash;this is one of its
greatest faults.</p>

<p>At the foreign watering-places, the passion for
play is not considered a vice&mdash;it is looked on as an
amusement, rather <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comme il faut</i>; my neighbour,
therefore, notwithstanding his regular attendance
at the gambling-table, was still supposed to be an
honourable man and a gentleman.</p>

<p>M. Raymond had been present at some of my
<i>séances</i>, and seemed to take particular delight in
them. Often had he spoken to me in such terms,
as proved his thorough knowledge of the art of
jugglery in general, and about tricks with cards in
particular. When we were alone, he even showed
me with what facility he could make a false cut,
change one card for another, &amp;c., &amp;c. I therefore
looked on him as a very clever amateur in these
manœuvres.</p>

<p>Our having the same tastes, I may say the same
passion, in common, contributed to add to our intimacy,
and few days passed that we did not take
long walks together in the neighbourhood. Our
conversation turned, as may be supposed very
frequently, on our favourite topic. We also spoke
about "Roulette" and "Rouge-et-Noir," but on
these subjects we seldom agreed, and my neighbour
grew quite exasperated, when I said that I had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
horror of gambling, and, that when I approached
the table covered with green cloth, it seemed to me
as if I were one of an assemblage of fools, or at
least lunatics of the worst description.</p>

<p>"Fools and lunatics!" exclaimed M. Raymond;
"you seem to be ignorant of the study necessary,
of the strength of mind and talent required, to
contend against bad luck. You are not aware that
the art of turning lucky chances in your favour, is
not a chimera, and that it requires great talent to
be able to duly estimate the value of the chances."</p>

<p>One day, after a long discussion more than usually
excited, M. Raymond, finding that he rather had
the worst of the argument, thought to convince me
by letting me a little into his confidence.</p>

<p>"Ah! Well, you say you have a horror of gambling,
and will never play. Wait and see. I bet
that in an hour you will be so wild about it, that
I shall be obliged to restrain and guide you."</p>

<p>I made a gesture of denial.</p>

<p>"Pray listen to me;" added he; "only when
you've heard what I have to tell, I must ask you to
guard sacredly the secret I am about to confide to
you.</p>

<p>"You probably share the generally received
opinion, that I have a large fortune. I may say
that I am rich, as my funds come from a source<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
that is inexhaustible. At the same time, I do not
mind confessing to you, that I have no other funds
than my wits, or, in other words, my skill in play.
I live by the profits I derive from the gambling-table.
I could prove to you, that there is not a
year that I do not make money at roulette, clearing
at least twenty thousand francs (800<i>l.</i>). You
naturally inquire how?&mdash;I am going to teach
you.</p>

<p>"It has long been the custom to hold up to ridicule
those, who, having little trust in fate, seek to
make their fortunes by the aid of lucky combinations
at play, more or less ingenious.</p>

<p>"Even if the result disappoint you day after day,
ought you, therefore, to conclude that it is not to be
obtained?</p>

<p>"I have every reason for believing the contrary,
and, when you have heard what I have to say, you
will agree with me on the subject.</p>

<p>"To make these explanations more intelligible,
I ought, in the first place, to establish the following
aphorism: 'That all games of chance present two
kinds of chances perfectly distinct: those which
belong to the player, and those which are inherent
in the combinations of the game.'</p>

<p>"The chances in favour of the player are represented
by two mysterious agents, known by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
names of loss and gain, or perhaps by the more
characteristic ones of good and ill-luck.</p>

<p>"The chances of the game are termed probabilities.</p>

<p>"A probability is the relation which exists,
between the number of chances favourable to a
result, and the sum total of possible chances.</p>

<p>"Some celebrated authors have written clever
works on these same probabilities, but, in consequence
of their profound depth and multiplicity,
these calculations are of no earthly use to the
player.</p>

<p>"Besides, all systems of probabilities may be
advantageously replaced by the following <span class="locked">theory:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"If chance should happen to bring every possible
combination of the game, there are, notwithstanding,
certain limits, where it must cease.</p>

<p>"Such, for example, as the fact of a number
coming up ten consecutive times at roulette.</p>

<p>"That might happen, certainly, but it has never
yet occurred. We may therefore conclude, <span class="locked">that:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"In a game of hazard, the oftener a number
comes up, the more certain it is that it will not
come up the next <i>coup</i>.</p>

<p>"This is the groundwork of all the theories of
probabilities, and is termed 'the maturity of
chances.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
"After what I have stated, it is evident, that, in
order to succeed, a person must only continue to
play, when he is fortunate at the commencement,
and must also only risk his money, at the instant
prescribed by the rules of the maturity of chances.</p>

<p>"Some sort of introduction was necessary, but
I have made it as short as possible."</p>

<p>Here M. Raymond, wishing doubtless to give me
time to reflect on what he had said, stopped short,
pulled his pocket-handkerchief out of his pocket,
blew his nose several times, and then <span class="locked">continued:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"My theory is embodied in the following precepts,
under the title of</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>ADVICE TO PLAYERS.</h3>

<p>"1st. In playing, give the preference to the game
of roulette, as it gives you the chance of investing
your money in several <span class="locked">ways,<a name="FNanchor_E" id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a></span> and also enables you
to study at the same time various chances and
maturities.</p>

<p>"2nd. A good player must be calm, and must
keep his temper. A man who gives way to passion
is sure to lose.</p>

<p>"If, as is said to be the case, gambling produces
the most delightful sensations; as all happiness in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
this world has its reverse of pain and suffering,
it is almost certain, that the anticipated pleasure
of winning is balanced by many bitterly-deceived
hopes.</p>

<p>"<i>The man who likes gambling must take the risk
of losing.</i></p>

<p>"3rd. A prudent player ought, before beginning,
to observe, and obtain proof if possible, whether he
is in a lucky vein or not.</p>

<p>"If there be any doubt about it, he must abstain
from playing.</p>

<p>"4th. There are some whom ill-luck pursues
incessantly. To these I would say: <i>never play</i>.</p>

<p>"5th. An experienced player ought always to
avoid joining in partnership, with those unlucky
people who always lose. Nothing is so contagious
as ill-luck. Be careful never to place your money
with that of unfortunate players. On the other
hand, always place your money with those whom
you see are lucky.</p>

<p>"6th. Accustom yourself to be one of the last to
place your money, so that your play may not influence
others who are also holding back.</p>

<p>"7th. Endeavour to choose for playing, the moment
when you see there are most players; the
<i>coups</i> are then less rapid, and one has more time
to study them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
"8th. Never think of playing, unless you have
your brain quite clear. Let the voice of the
<i>croupier</i> and the card on which you have marked
the points, occupy your thoughts. Isolate yourself
in the midst of the crowd.</p>

<p>"9th. Never try a chance until it is ripe, or has
arrived at its maturity. This system will often
oblige a novice to remain inactive; but practice
will enable him to play every time, as he will know
how to profit by <i>all</i> the chances attached to the
combinations of the game.</p>

<p>"10th. If the calculations, founded upon your
luck, or upon probabilities, are disappointed, cease
playing at once, to try your luck again at a more
favourable opportunity.</p>

<p>"<i>Obstinacy in playing is ruin.</i></p>

<p>"11th. Never play for more than two hours;
beyond that time, brain and fortune become weary
of being kept too long on the rack.</p>

<p>"12th. To acquire the sort of impassibility I
advocate, hide, in the recesses of your own heart,
any and all emotions, which the fact of winning may
produce, be the sum ever so considerable. Remember
that your good luck ought never to make you rejoice
too much, for, though Dame Fortune may shower
her favours upon you, she as often takes her revenge
on the imprudent whom success intoxicates."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
I had paid the greatest attention to the explanation
afforded me by M. Raymond. His system
appeared to me, if not infallible, at least a very
ingenious one; still I could not persuade myself,
that it was possible to command success. I wished,
however, to show him that I had perfectly understood
him.</p>

<p>"All your precepts are very clear," said I, with
an appearance of conviction, "and may be summed
up as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"<i>Before risking money at play, consider whether
you are in a lucky vein, and study the probabilities
of the game, or, as you call it, the maturity of
chances.</i>"</p>

<p>"Just so," rejoined M. Raymond. "This system
is so sure and certain, that I have latterly applied
it most successfully.</p>

<p>"This morning I felt that it was one of my
lucky days, those days so rare in the life of a
gambler.</p>

<p>"This feeling was so strong in me, that I felt
instinctively that something good would happen
to me.</p>

<p>"On arriving at the table, I, however, at first
only made a few trifling experiments at rouge-et-noir.</p>

<p>"My success confirmed my impressions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
"It would not have been prudent to exhaust the
vein of my good luck, so I stopped, and, taking a
card, began to study the maturity of the chances
before making my great <i>coup</i>.</p>

<p>"After an hour spent in making observations, I
thought the favourable moment had arrived, I
placed ten francs on No. 33. I lost: one must
expect that; but, confident in my successful vein,
even more than in the No. 33, the maturity of
which had not come to its full, I martingaled
four times <span class="locked">running.<a name="FNanchor_F" id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">F</a></span></p>

<p>"At the fifth <i>coup</i>, the probabilities proved in
the right. The ball stopped at my lucky number.</p>

<p>"My four martingales having amounted to eighty
francs, the sum paid me, according to the rules of
the game, was thirty-six times that amount. I
received 2880 francs (about 115<i>l.</i>).</p>

<p>"A fool would have gone on; but I, not wishing
to tempt fortune, and in order to avoid losing all my
gains, quitted the table."</p>

<p>Clever as was the system of M. Raymond, he
could not, however, imbue me with the wish of
risking the smallest sum at roulette. I have always
looked on this game, as a trap baited with the prospect
of an easy gain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
In fact, how many men have, like M. Raymond,
invented systems and theories to break the bank,
who have only succeeded in ruining themselves,
and any fools who would listen to them.</p>

</div>

<p>A few days afterwards, I quitted Spa to return
to France, and, as often happens with friends
picked up in one's travels, M. Raymond and I
parted, as I thought, never to meet again.</p>

<p>It was not, however, thus destined.</p>

<p>Two years afterwards I found myself at Baden-Baden,
and was walking on the Lichtenthal promenade.
A man I had not before observed, came,
and, placing himself suddenly before me, looked at
me, as much as to say: "Do you recognise me?"</p>

<p>This man, judging by his appearance, was not
one of the aristocracy of the Baden society. He
wore a brown coat, which had that peculiar shiny
look, which bespeaks long service. It was buttoned
up to the throat, to allow him to dispense
with the luxury of a waistcoat, or at least to prevent
a too minute inspection of his under garments.</p>

<p>His face was ornamented with a pair of large
"blondes moustaches," very carefully arranged.</p>

<p>"How the loss of a beard changes the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
of a man!" said a voice, which I recognised
immediately to be that of M. Raymond.</p>

<p>"True," I replied, somewhat absent by a remembrance
of former days crossing my brain: "It
is true, you are much changed." I looked at M.
Raymond; more old recollections crowded into my
mind. Those thick moustachios, that military
appearance, were connected with an event which
had once impressed me deeply. Still I could not
quite recall the facts to my mind.</p>

<p>"I will not longer interrupt you in your walk,"
said M. Raymond, moving away; feeling hurt probably
at my hesitation, of which he did not know
the cause&mdash;when I stopped him:</p>

<p>"You do not interrupt me, 'Mon Voisin,'" I said;
"let us walk on together, and we will go to a less
frequented part, where you will be able to relate
to me, more at your ease, all that has happened to
you since we parted."</p>

<p>"Ah! <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i>" replied poor Raymond with
a sigh, "my tale is a simple one; you shall judge
for yourself.</p>

<p>"A fortnight after your departure, my luck
turned. Bad luck pursued me, as it had never
done before. According to my principles, I
waited, hoping for a better chance; but my frightful
ill-luck continued for six months. I changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
my <i>locale</i>, to turn my luck, but all in vain. The
best-established maturities, the most wonderful
chances, all became, for me, elements of ruin.</p>

<p>"At my wits' end, as well as at the end of my
resources, I sold in succession, jewels, linen, and
clothes, by the proceeds of which I hoped to save
myself from ruin; but in vain.</p>

<p>"I played with caution, and studied in despair,
all the chances for and against me. I made nothing
but unlucky hits, and was soon reduced to
utter poverty.</p>

<p>"Ever since then, I have led the most extraordinary
existence in the world. Too proud to beg, I
endured with resignation the most cruel privations.
I cannot tell how it was, that I did not die of
hunger.</p>

<p>"You may well believe that I did not wish
to be recognised, in such a pitiable position. I,
the lucky gambler 'Voisin Raymond,' whom all
admired for his talent and good luck.</p>

<p>"I could not bear the pity of my former
admirers.</p>

<p>"I shaved off my beard, the type in some measure
of my greatness, and thus transformed, I lived
unknown, waiting for better days."</p>

<p>Proud, as M. Raymond seemed to be, I did not
think he would refuse a little assistance; but fearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
to wound his susceptibility, I contrived to slip
a napoleon into his hand, while giving it a parting
shake.</p>

<p>"I accept what you offer me, but only as a loan,"
said he, "remember that:&mdash;Thanks, '<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au revoir!</i>'"</p>

<p>On this, "Mon Voisin" quitted me, with much
precipitation.</p>

<p>Curious to learn what he intended to do, I
followed him unseen, and saw him direct his steps
to that yawning gulf, the roulette-table. I was not
surprised; all gamblers are alike.</p>

<p>The same evening, Raymond approached me
with a triumphant air.</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed he, "they are right who say
that borrowed money brings luck! Here I am,
again in a lucky vein; I have played prudently and
for small stakes; the result is, that I have won a
hundred francs. It is a return of my former good
fortune. Allow me, therefore, while thanking you,
to retain for a time the napoleon you lent me; I
look on it as a talisman, by means of which I hope
to get out of all my difficulties."</p>

<p>Cruel deception! The following day, the talisman
and its luck fell a prey to the rake of the hard-hearted
<i>croupier</i>.</p>

<p>"A few more francs," said Raymond, when relating
this misfortune, "and I could have stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
out against my unlucky vein. You must know, my
system has completely changed, and I feel so confident
in my new system, that, with only three
hundred francs, I feel assured that I could break
the bank."</p>

<p>From all this, I saw that Raymond had lost, if
not his wits, at least his judgment.</p>

<p>"You had much better leave Baden, Raymond,"
I said to him, "and devote yourself to some less
dangerous occupation. Were you never in any
profession, which you could again take up?"</p>

<p>"Alas! The profession I exercised formerly, was
one still more dangerous; I quitted it twenty years
since, and I swore never to resume it again."</p>

<p>This explanation, short as it was, threw a sudden
light upon the vague recollections, which the altered
face of Raymond had awakened in my mind.</p>

<p>"Wait," said I to him, looking at him attentively.
"Yes! It certainly is,&mdash;were you not
some twenty years since at a ball, which was given
at the Veau qui Tête?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Well, what of it?"</p>

<p>"Do you recollect being questioned, after an
unusual run of luck at <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">écarte</i>, and how you afterwards
were chased by the police?"</p>

<p>"I remember the circumstance," replied Raymond,
with the greatest calmness, "and the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
so, because, as a termination to that scene and
many preceding ones, finding myself tracked and
nearly discovered, I fled to Germany, abandoning
my dangerous career for a more tranquil and
honest life.</p>

<p>"I there took another name, and with my thick
beard, which almost hid my features, few would
have recognised me; of this you can judge for
yourself."</p>

<p>This candid avowal gave me hopes of obtaining
from Raymond, an account of his former life,
which could not but be interesting. I hoped to
find there some facts, which would be of use for
the work I was writing on sharpers. I did not
hesitate to ask him to oblige me, and, in the hope
of inducing him to admit me into his confidence,
I offered to lend him three hundred francs (£12),
which he was to return, when he had made his
fortune. It was <i>giving</i> them to him, under another
form.</p>

<p>Raymond agreed to both my propositions, but
begged to be allowed until the morrow, to enable
him to collect his ideas a little.</p>

<span class="subhead">EDIFYING HISTORY OF A GREEK.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hangcenter">Debauchery&mdash;Scheme to get money&mdash;The usurer Robineau&mdash;The bill of
exchange&mdash;A false friend&mdash;Treason&mdash;Stay at Clichy&mdash;Initiation of
a sharper&mdash;Release from prison.</p></blockquote>

<p>Raymond kept his promise. He came to me
the following day; and, after I had made my
arrangements, so that no one should interrupt us, I
asked him to begin his story.</p>

<p>"It is not my intention," said he, "to tell you
the history of my life; I shall only relate to you my
<i>début</i> as a Greek, and the causes which so fatally
led to it. After that, I will tell you some startling
incidents, of which I have been the hero, the
accomplice, or the witness.</p>

<p>"My real name, and the place of my birth, are
of little consequence. I shall not mention them,
out of respect to my family, one of the members
of which holds a very high position in Paris; to
you, therefore, I shall be simply M. Raymond.</p>

<p>"At the age of twenty, I was a tolerably good-looking
fellow, and came into possession of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
fortune of about ten thousand francs (400<i>l.</i>) a year.
Being an orphan, I had no one to control me, and
led, in consequence, one of the fastest and most
dissolute lives in the metropolis.</p>

<p>"In two years my patrimony was all spent, and
I found myself ruined.</p>

<p>"As always happens in such cases, my friends
turned their backs on me, and, as must also always
happen, it was necessary for me to exist; but
how? A serious question, for one who had never
had any other profession than idleness and debauchery.</p>

<p>"The idea of suicide occurred to me, but
whether it was cowardice, or submission to fate,
that prevented me, I know not, but I continued
to live on."</p>

<p>M. Raymond then related several piquant anecdotes,
as he called them.</p>

<p>As a faithful historian I shall transcribe them
for the benefit of my readers; but, as they will be
easier to recount in the third person, I shall in
future adopt that method.</p>

<p>Raymond was thus abandoned, as he had
stated, by all his friends, with one exception.
This faithful friend, named Brissac, was the same
age as himself; he had been the companion of his
follies, and would now share his misfortunes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
They had one purse in common,&mdash;that is to say,
they starved together.</p>

<p>Brissac's active mind was never at a loss; every
day brought forth some new scheme, for restoring
their broken fortunes.</p>

<p>"I say, Raymond," exclaimed Brissac, one
morning, awakening his comrade; "I've got an
idea! In a few days we shall be rolling in wealth.
It only requires a couple of thousand francs (£80),
no more; and this is what we must do to procure
that sum.</p>

<p>"I am acquainted with an old money-lender,
named Robineau; a sly, suspicious old fellow, and
such a rogue, that an escaped convict would blush
before him. He shall be our banker. I don't
mind confessing to you that my credit with him is
quite gone, so I can ask nothing for myself; but
<i>you</i> might very well beg him to lend you the sum
I named."</p>

<p>"No doubt I can <i>ask</i> for it," said Raymond,
"nothing is more easy; but to <i>obtain</i> it, is another
thing. You know these usurers always require
security."</p>

<p>"I know that. Of coarse, you will offer security
to this honest Robineau."</p>

<p>"You are joking."</p>

<p>"No, on the contrary, I am quite serious. Listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
to me; you will offer Robineau a bill of exchange,
and, at the same time, tell him to make all necessary
inquiries about you in your native place. As no
one there yet knows that you are ruined, there is
no doubt, that, after making these inquiries, and
satisfying himself of your respectability, he will
give you what you require. We'll find means of
paying him some day or other," added Brissac,
by way of quieting his conscience.</p>

<p>Everything occurred as Brissac had predicted.
In consideration of a bill for two thousand five
hundred francs, at one month's date, renewable
only with the consent of Père Robineau, he handed
over to Raymond two bank-notes of a thousand
francs each.</p>

<p>The friends had been so long deprived of anything
like pleasure, that they determined to enjoy
themselves to their hearts' content. They took
care, however, to be economical, so that the money
lasted them for a fortnight, at the end of which
time, they were worse off than before.</p>

<p>They again applied to Robineau, but this time he
was inflexible.</p>

<p>"When you have paid me your original debt,"
said he, "I shall have more confidence in you, and
will lend you a larger sum."</p>

<p>The dreaded moment arrived; the bill was presented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
and of course was not paid. Père Robineau
lost no time in adopting such stringent legal
measures, that, to escape a prison, Raymond saw
himself reduced to live the life of a recluse, never
venturing to leave the house.</p>

<p>To crown all their miseries, Brissac, who, by
some means more or less honest, always catered for
the two, found himself in the same predicament as
his friend.</p>

<p>A bill, with his signature attached, in the hands
of Robineau, was almost due; but Brissac was not
a man to allow himself to be caught. He resolved
to free himself by an act of treacherous perfidy.</p>

<p>He went to the money-lender, and frankly told
him he was penniless, and that therefore it would
be useless to imprison him; but that, on the other
hand, his friend was quite solvent; and he offered to
get him a bill signed by Raymond, for a thousand
francs, in exchange for his own, promising at the
same time to assist him to entrap his invisible
debtor.</p>

<p>The offer was accepted, and Brissac immediately
commenced putting his infamous project into
execution.</p>

<p>He made Raymond believe that he had found a
more accommodating money-lender, who had promised
to let him have a thousand francs on his bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
No sooner does Brissac get possession of the
paper, than he hastens to Père Robineau, gives it to
him in exchange for his own, and returns to Raymond
to carry out his scheme.</p>

<p>"All goes on well," said he to Raymond; "but
there is a little formality necessary. Our new
banker declines to give the money to any one but
yourself. You had better come with me to satisfy
him."</p>

<p>"Yes, but," replied Raymond, "I might be
recognised, and taken by the bailiffs, on my way
there."</p>

<p>"I foresaw this difficulty, and have a carriage
at the door with the blinds drawn; so we have
nothing to fear."</p>

<p>Unconscious of evil, Raymond starts on his way.
The two friends congratulate themselves on their
good fortune, and are laughing in their sleeves at the
trick they are playing the bailiffs, when, suddenly,
at the command of a strange voice, the carriage
stops, and a man, in an authoritative tone, after
desiring Brissac to get out, takes his place, and
orders the coachman to drive to Clichy.</p>

<p>"Adieu! Raymond," cried out his perfidious
friend as the carriage drove off, "adieu! Keep up
your courage. Adieu!"</p>

<p>Whilst Voisin Raymond was telling me this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
I observed, that he could not prevent a nervous
clinching of his fists.</p>

<p>"I may well be enraged at this villain's infamy,"
said he, with his teeth set and his eyes sparkling
with rage, "for it is to my stay at Clichy that I
owe my entrance into the path of crime."</p>

<p>The prisoner was as unhappy as he would
naturally be under such circumstances, but, on
reflection, he found that his condition was not so
bad as he had at first thought; at all events, he
would, for some time to come, be sheltered from
want.</p>

<p>His companions in misfortune seemed all of
them far from despairing. Each of them appeared
to bear his troubles with patience. They treated
one another to dinners and fêtes, at which ladies
were present. Cards were also permitted, and
imaginary stakes of large amount, were played for
by these insolvents.</p>

<p>From his first entrance, whilst most of his companions
held themselves aloof from him, Raymond
was attracted towards a man named Andréas, who
had shown a compassionate interest in him.</p>

<p>This man, although he was twenty years older,
became his friend and confidant; and to him
Raymond related his youthful follies, his difficulties,
and his misfortunes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Andréas, on his part, also made a confidant
of Raymond; one thing led to another, and at
length he told him some secrets of a compromising
nature. He confessed that he had the art of
mastering the caprices of fortune, or, as Cardinal
Mazarin said: "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Prendre au jeu ses avantages</i>."</p>

<p>Andréas even offered to initiate Raymond into
these rascally manœuvres, and to work with him
so as to gull the dupes of "Sainte Pélagie."</p>

<p>Raymond, who had long ago ceased to be
honest, did not feel affronted at such advances
being made to him; he accepted the offer of
going into partnership, and worked with zeal to
become an adept in his new profession.</p>

<p>His progress was rapid, as in prison there is
little to distract the attention, and one can devote
one's whole time to study.</p>

<p>The partners at once commenced a crusade
against the purses of their fellow-prisoners, and
were so successful, that, in less than a year, they
had gained sufficient to recover their liberty.</p>

<p>One day they sent for Père Robineau to come
to Clichy, saying it was for an affair of great
importance.</p>

<p>The cunning old man knew well enough what
his presence there was required for, so he took with
him the necessary papers for the liberation of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
debtor. Thanks to his zeal, the needful formalities
were soon gone through, and Raymond found
himself once more on the pavement of Paris, which
has an especial charm for such of its inhabitants as
have not trodden it for a twelvemonth.</p>

<p>Andréas also was set at liberty; the two associates
met, and agreed never to part again.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hangcenter">Greeks, both as dupers and duped&mdash;Andréas Tête d'Or&mdash;Secret inquiry&mdash;The
human ostrich&mdash;The society of philosophers&mdash;Chaffard the
bravo&mdash;Exploit of Tête d'Or&mdash;A Greek thrown out of window&mdash;Mystification.</p></blockquote>

<p>When Raymond entered the prison of "Sainte
Pélagie" he was an isolated being in Paris. On
his exit it was different; Andréas had friends who
also became the friends of Raymond, and in many
of the houses in which he was received, he met
with a most cordial welcome.</p>

<p>They soon treated him as a brother, using the
friendly "thou" in addressing him, and even gave
him the <i>soubriquet</i> of "The Marquis," from his
fashionable appearance. Andréas was named Tête
d'Or, or "Golden Head," in consequence of his
fertile and inventive imagination.</p>

<p>Raymond was not long in discovering, that
the society he now frequented, was composed
of Chevaliers d'Industrie, and that the houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
where he had been so well received, were nothing
more than gambling-houses, where those who were
imprudent enough to enter, were soon fleeced of
their money.</p>

<p>As Raymond was very expert at tricks of cards,
they gave him, every now and then, certain tricks
to execute; and in every instance he performed his
<i>rôle</i> with as much adroitness as tact.</p>

<p>In these houses, the trial of skill was marvellous,
and it was not uncommon, to see as many dupers
as duped at each table.</p>

<p>The tables and play were kept up by a sort of
partnership; that is to say, every Greek paid his
share towards the general fund.</p>

<p>At the end of the evening, after all the dupes
had departed, the Greeks placed what they had
gained on a table, and shared it equally.</p>

<p>Although wolves do not prey upon each other,
thieves not unfrequently do: that is certain.</p>

<p>It often happened, that, after a game was over,
at which the dupes had lost a hundred louis (£80),
when they came to divide, there were only sixty
forthcoming.</p>

<p>Every one of the players agreed that there ought
to be more, but no one acknowledged to having
taken the missing money.</p>

<p>They looked at each other, and even made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
personal search (for in such company delicacy is
needless), but found nothing.</p>

<p>At length they hit on an idea; they agreed to
request Tête d'Or to make a secret investigation,
in order to discover which was the culprit.</p>

<p>Andréas, flattered at being selected to fill so delicate
a post, put all his zeal and intelligence in requisition,
and soon detected the two delinquents, as
well as the tricks they had employed to cheat the
society.</p>

<p>It appeared, that one of these men gave orders
to his servant, to come towards the end of every
evening, to ask his master for a key, or for some
other trifling errand. Whilst giving him the key,
he also handed over to him a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rouleau</i> of the
louis he had gained. If the winnings were considerable,
the servant, at a sign from his master,
returned with the key, and in giving it back
received a second <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rouleau</i>.</p>

<p>Another, more modest, contented himself with
sticking a few louis under the table with small
bits of wax, collecting them after the division of
the spoils was over.</p>

<p>A third, a sort of human ostrich, swallowed
the money, and afterwards took an emetic to
recover it.</p>

<p>These double-faced thieves, once known, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
expelled, as not being worthy to belong to an
association, which boasted of being proof against all
temptation.</p>

<p>It occasionally occurred, that false money was
mixed up with the genuine coin. But the author
of this fraud could never be discovered; so no
notice was taken of the circumstance, as the false
money was so good an imitation, that none of the
party had any scruples about circulating it amongst
their trades-people.</p>

<p>Andréas, at length, felt wearied of wasting his
talents for the benefit of people, whom he considered
much his inferiors in intellect. He required
a larger field for the display of his powers; and
consequently proposed to Raymond, to quit "The
Lynx Society" (for so was the association named),
to form, conjointly with a man called Chaffard, who
was nick-named Prévôt (or the Fencing Master), a
society for the cultivation of Parisian and provincial
dupes.</p>

<p>It was called the Society of Philosophers,
and the different members were employed as
<span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Chaffard used to travel about from time to time,
to discover victims; he likewise had to put himself
in communication with the sharpers of the provinces,
and to negotiate with them for those undertakings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
in which the experience of masters in the
art was necessary.</p>

<p>If Chaffard was not as clever in handling cards,
as his comrades, he was in no way their inferior in
cunning and rascality.</p>

<p>He possessed one talent in particular, which,
when occasion required, was of much avail to them.</p>

<p>He was a first-rate bully, always ready to quarrel
with a dupe, even whilst he was robbing him, so
that many, to avoid being killed by this miscreant,
would quietly allow themselves to be swindled out
of their money. In such cases his usual language
was, "Very well, sir; there is only one thing to be
done&mdash;we must fight. I am at your service, &amp;c., &amp;c."</p>

<p>If, by chance, any person happened to argue a
point, or expostulate with either of them, Chaffard
immediately interposed, espoused his friend's quarrel,
and offered to fight in his stead; for Andréas
and Raymond were not courageous, and this was
the reason, that they had deemed it prudent to ally
themselves with a bravo.</p>

<p>Chaffard was, in truth, the defender and support
of the association.</p>

<p>The character of Raymond, "The Marquis," was,
on the contrary, quiet and inoffensive. His manners
savoured of the best society. Intelligent and
adroit, he willingly undertook to work at balls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
parties, and other mixed assemblies. By degrees,
he managed to get introduced into the <i>salons</i> of
the rich middling classes, where he exercised his
vocation with as much prudence as talent.</p>

<p>Andréas, or "Golden Head," also enjoyed a
certain distinction in his line, which lay in secret
gambling houses. There it was that he usually
displayed his talents.</p>

<p>There, he not only found easy dupes, but
often, thanks to the depth of his plots, and his
extreme cleverness, he managed to take in sharpers
themselves.</p>

<p>In addition to his other qualities, Andréas possessed
wonderful presence of mind, of which he was
extremely proud; and in proof of this he had told
Raymond the following <span class="locked">circumstance:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>At the period when he first began his dangerous
career, and was not yet very expert, he was playing
at one of the secret clubs frequented by all the
great gamblers of Paris.</p>

<p>Whilst playing, he was caught in the fact of
cheating, and certain cards which he was trying to
introduce into the game of lansquenet, were seized.
They were on the point of delivering him over into
the hands of justice, when one of the players judiciously
observed, that, as the assembly in which
the circumstance occurred was not quite legal, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
denunciation might bring about awkward results;
besides the trouble and delay of producing the
necessary proofs.</p>

<p>"Would it not be more simple," continued this
sage counsellor, "to punish the rascal ourselves,
by throwing him out of the window; and, should
he reach <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">terra firma</i> in safety, after his aërial
excursion, he will never think of appealing against
his sentence."</p>

<p>All present, agreed that this would be the wisest
plan, and unanimously decided, that they should
proceed at once to the infliction of the punishment.</p>

<p>As soon as Andréas heard this sentence pronounced,
he threw himself on his knees to sue for
pardon, and, with clasped hands, implored the pity
of his judges, pointing out to them that the first
floor, on which they were, was very high from the
ground, owing to there being an <i>entresol</i> between it
and the ground-floor.</p>

<p>All his appeals, however, were in vain.</p>

<p>One of the players, who had lost more than
any of his companions, insisted, not only that no
clemency should be shown him, but that the rogue
should be compelled to return the money which he
had stolen.</p>

<p>This restitution seemed easy enough, as the green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
silk purse, into which Andréas had put his own
money and that of his victims, was on the table
beside him.</p>

<p>"I will return it, if you insist on it," cried
Andréas, in a heart-broken voice, placing the purse
on the table, "but, oh! do not kill me."</p>

<p>Their only reply was to open both the shutters
and the window.</p>

<p>Four of the strongest of the group were selected,
to launch the culprit into space.</p>

<p>They approached to seize him, when Andréas
suddenly formed the resolution of leaping out
himself, made a bound forward through the open
window, and, in true gymnastic style, came down
on his feet in the street below.</p>

<p>Stunned by his fall, he staggered at first, then
hobbling away, he ended by starting off at full
speed, to the astonishment of the spectators in the
balcony above, who laughed loudly at this serio-comic
performance.</p>

<p>When their hilarity was over, they bethought
themselves of sharing the contents of the purse
which contained all the losses they had experienced
during the evening.</p>

<p>One amongst the party was named to arrange
the affair, but, as the whole of the money was mixed
up in it, together with that of the robber himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
it was agreed that it would be better to give it to
the poor.</p>

<p>Wishing to know the amount the purse contained,
they emptied it on the table, when what
was their astonishment at finding nothing in it but
counters.</p>

<p>Andréas, in case of accidents, always carried a
second purse, filled with false money; and, even in
the critical position in which he had been placed,
he had sufficient presence of mind to substitute the
false purse for the real one.</p>

<p>In relating this adventure of former days,
Andréas always concluded with these words: "I
took good care never to be caught again."</p>

takes her reprisal.</p></blockquote>

<p>The three associates at first always worked
together, and made some good hits in several of the
gambling houses in the metropolis; but finding at
length, that, as the number of Greeks increased,
the number of victims lessened, they determined
on starting a clandestine hell of their own, at the
head of which they placed a very respectable lady
of their acquaintance, named Madame de Haut-Castel,
familiarly called "la Pompadour."</p>

<p>To Chaffard was deputed the task of recruiting
for dupes, and drawing them away from other
houses.</p>

<p>This establishment prospered very well for some
time, but, one fine day, they perceived that their
affairs were entangled.</p>

<p>A good number of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">habitués</i>, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
introduced as dupes, after having been cleaned out
by the masters of the place, took their revenge
on the new recruits, and fleeced them with infinite
skill.</p>

<p>Andréas soon suspected, that there was no faith to
be placed in the "Fencing-Master," and discovered
that he, in conjunction with "la Pompadour," whose
admirer and devoted slave he had become, had
started a sort of class, for men who had nearly
ruined themselves by gambling; to whom, for a
handsome <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">douceur</i>, they taught some of their best
tricks in cheating.</p>

<p>The two other associates were incensed at this
discovery, but dared not show how exasperated
they were, fearing, as they did, the sword of
Chaffard; so they contented themselves with concealing
their disgust, and paying him off in his own
coin. They decided to quit Paris; and, giving as
a reason, their wish to explore the watering and
bathing places during the summer season, they left
the establishment in Paris to the care of the
"Fencing-Master," with full power to do what he
pleased, nay even to dispose of it if he liked.</p>

<p>During their journey, the two rogues invented
and arranged, the most cunning and dexterous
tricks.</p>

<p>They particularly made a study of a practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
well known amongst Greeks, and called "le Service,"
which is neither more nor less, than a series
of almost imperceptible signals.</p>

<p>The following is the way their scheme was carried
out.</p>

<p>The two confederates bend their steps towards
some watering place, which is known to be frequented
by gamblers.</p>

<p>Raymond, "The Marquis," has the principal <i>rôle</i>
allotted to him. He arrives; goes to the best
hotel, and passes himself off as a rich young heir-presumptive,
or an eldest son.</p>

<p>He is careful not to call himself a Russian prince,
or an Englishman, as both these characters have
been so often assumed by swindlers, that that fact
alone would raise suspicion. Indeed, the names of
Russian princes and rich English families, are now
so well-known to the Greeks, that he could not,
without danger, venture to create new names and
titles for either of these countries.</p>

<p>At the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">table d'hôte</i> of the hotel, Raymond, by
his polite, easy, and elegant manners, wins golden
opinions from the persons around him. After
dinner, he joins his new friends, walks out with
them, and afterwards goes with them to look on at
the gambling-tables.</p>

<p>If he plays, it is with great caution and moderation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
He generally contents himself with looking
on, that is to say, he watches the play of his future
victims, and never attempts a <i>coup</i>, until the arrival
of his associate. He is sure not to be long after
him, and selects an hotel as far as possible from that
of his accomplice.</p>

<p>The two scamps, when they meet, feign not to
know one another; they even affect to have no tastes
in common.</p>

<p>Andréas walks up to the gambling-table with an
air of indifference, makes one or two bets, as if he
did not care much whether he won or lost, and
refuses to take the cards, under the pretence that he
does not know how to play.</p>

<p>But the time arrives, when these gentlemen commence
their real game.</p>

<p>They are seated at an écarté-table.</p>

<p>Raymond is playing. At first, to prevent suspicion,
he loses several games, and resigns his hand,
which, however, when the play is animated and the
stakes high, he takes up again.</p>

<p>Andréas is betting on the opposite side, but his
bets are so trifling, that it will make little difference
to the pair, even should he lose.</p>

<p>This artful accomplice takes up a standing position,
behind his victim, and opposite his friend.
With his hands behind his back, he seems as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
if he cared very little about the game. But all
the time, he is paying the greatest attention, and
working his secret telegraph for the benefit of
Raymond.</p>

<p>I will endeavour to explain, in a few words, this
formidable system of trickery.</p>

<h3>THE SECRET TELEGRAPH.</h3>

<p>The number of cards required in the game of
Piquet is thirty-two; now all these thirty-two cards,
may, by this system, be pointed out by twelve
signals, that is to say, eight for the value of the cards,
and four for the suits.</p>

<p>At Écarté, the number of signals is still less,
as it is only requisite to designate the numbers.</p>

<p>But to make these signals, it is not necessary, as
stated by some authors, to use any exaggerated
signs, such as to cough, sneeze, blow the nose, or
beat a tattoo on the table. They must have a very
low estimate of the Greek, if they suppose him
capable of these palpable evolutions.</p>

<p>No; the modern Greek would be ashamed of
such childish performances. Unfortunately for the
dupes, the signals he makes, can only be seen and
recognised by his accomplice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Of this, my readers will be able to judge for
themselves, by the following explanatory <span class="locked">table:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>If the confederate looks <span class="locked">at&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center">
<table class="signals" summary="Signals">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">1. His associate, he means</td>
    <td class="tdl bot">A king.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">2. The cards of his adversary</td>
    <td class="tdl bot">A queen.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">3. The stakes</td>
    <td class="tdl bot">A knave.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">4. The opposite side</td>
    <td class="tdl bot">An ace.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>And at the same time that he tells the card, he
also tells the colour, by the following signs:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="signals" summary="Signals">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">1. The mouth slightly open</td>
    <td class="tdl bot">A heart.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">2. The mouth shut</td>
    <td class="tdl bot">A diamond.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">3. The upper lip slightly projecting over the under</td>
    <td class="tdl bot">A club.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">4. The under lip projecting beyond the upper</td>
    <td class="tdl bot">A spade.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Thus, for instance, if the Greek wishes to tell,
that the adversary holds the queen, the knave,
and the ace of hearts; he looks successively, at the
cards of his adversary, at the stakes, and on the
opposite side, holding his mouth slightly open the
whole time.</p>

<p>From this it will be seen, that the secret telegraph
may be used for all games alike, and put in
requisition wherever there are spectators. In fact,
nothing is more easy at piquet, than to indicate by
the aid of these signals, when you are to take in
cards, and when to refuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
I have only thought it necessary, to give an
example of some of the simplest and easiest
signs; but I may add, that some sharpers have
a large, and varied catalogue of signals, to
designate different things, as circumstances require.</p>

<p>This secret telegraph is so nearly imperceptible,
that it is difficult to describe, and quite impossible
to detect.</p>

<p>The Greek, who is playing, is careful not to
win always. After three or four runs of luck, he
loses and leaves the table, according to the instructions
conveyed by his confederate. This is called
"The Retreat."</p>

<p>To cover any losses incurred by this move, the
accomplice has taken care to double his bets, and
thus to reimburse themselves for their voluntary
sacrifice.</p>

<p>Andréas and his friend were, moreover, adepts
in every kind of sleight of hand trick, which, in
many instances, they rendered still more advantageous,
by performing what they termed "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Coups
en duplicata</i>."</p>

<p>Thus, for example, if they were together at the
same bouillotte table, they pretended not to be
acquainted with one another, and even looked at
each other with cool indifference; thus they could,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
whilst playing, very well manage to cheat, without
exciting suspicion.</p>

<p>Instead of each cheating to win for himself, as
might be supposed, they artfully contrived that
the one who had the deal, and held the cards,
should have bad cards and lose, whilst his confederate
had all the luck, and won.</p>

<p>Sometimes, whilst giving all four kings to his
accomplice, the other would also manage, to hand
over the four queens to one of their victims, so
as to raise his hopes, and induce him to double his
stakes.</p>

<p>The villany of these rogues, therefore, could not
be suspected, as the dealer never was the winner.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was at Boulogne-sur-Mer, that Andréas and
Raymond fixed themselves, to carry on their
criminal performances. The people there, were
rich and prosperous, and the harvest was abundant;
though it was rather lessened by their gains
being shared with Achille Chauvignac, the swindler
<i>par excellence</i> of the place, who pointed out to
them where the best game lay.</p>

<p>I must here pause to say a few words.</p>

<p>Hearing so much said of the enormous profits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
gained by swindlers, the reader will, naturally
enough, conceive, that in the end, all Greeks
must of necessity become millionaires and capitalists.</p>

<p>Far from it; notwithstanding their great profits,
this reprobate class never prospers; on an average,
out of every hundred Greeks, 99+1 die in want.
The explanation is easy.</p>

<p>The recruits of "modern Greece," without exception,
are men whose debauchery and prodigality
have brought them to ruin.</p>

<p>Nothing would be more difficult, than to make
a sharper thrifty and economical. They are all
dissolute, prodigal, and ostentatious, according to
their means.</p>

<p>These gentlemen, far from proportioning their
expenses to their incomes, think not of the future,
and live in extravagant luxury. They have horses,
carriages, mistresses, &amp;c., &amp;c., and each one endeavours
to outdo all his acquaintance in his expenditure.</p>

<p>It is hardly credible, but nevertheless true, that
a sharper sometimes loses money at play. These
men, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">blasés</i> with the successes which they themselves
have created, sometimes sigh for the excitement
caused by real play. To obtain it, they rush
to the roulette or rouge-et-noir table. In these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
two games the Greek finds retributive justice, and
fortune takes a sure revenge for many former deeds
of wrong.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DOCTOR DUPED.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The false capitalist&mdash;The rogue is bled&mdash;More confederates arrive&mdash;A
good hand&mdash;The fleecing&mdash;The doctor bled.</p></blockquote>

<p>After quitting Boulogne, our two heroes intended
to have gone into the South of France,
but their plans were changed by a proposal made
to them by Chauvignac.</p>

<p>There was a physician, living at St. Omer, who
had an irresistible love of gambling, and the proposal
made by Chauvignac was, that they should
relieve him of some thousands of francs.</p>

<p>Chauvignac was to give them all the information
necessary, and for this, he asked a third of the
profits; only, as he was the intimate friend of the
doctor, it was agreed that he must not appear in
the affair.</p>

<p>The two performers in this drama, were not long
in making their arrangements.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, they arrived at the
Hôtel d'Angleterre, the best in the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Andréas passed himself off for a rich Parisian
capitalist, who, charmed by the beauty of the place,
and the simple manners of the country, wished to
purchase an estate in the neighbourhood. He was
accompanied by a friend, who had come to give
him his opinion and advice in this affair.</p>

<p>They made several excursions, visited all the
places that were for sale, but ended by finding
nothing on a scale grand enough to suit the would-be
proprietor.</p>

<p>At the termination of their searches, the millionaire
announced that he was going to return to the
capital, and was on the point of departing, when
he was suddenly taken very ill.</p>

<p>According to his wishes, the best medical man
in the place, the friend of Chauvignac, was sent for.</p>

<p>On his arrival, the son of Esculapius began
asking various questions, to find out what was the
nature of his patient's malady.</p>

<p>"Ah! Sir," replied Andréas in a mournful voice,
"I cannot tell you what has caused this illness,
which compels me to keep my bed; all I know is,
that I suffer horribly in my head. I have unhappily
every reason to fear, from the symptoms, a
return of a brain fever, of which I have already had
several attacks."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself," said the doctor, "we will try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
and ward off the evil, this time, by bleeding you
copiously."</p>

<p>"Do so, if you please," responded the rascal, "I
place myself in your hands."</p>

<p>Andréas was accordingly bled, and soon afterwards
declared he already felt better.</p>

<p>"I will come again, and see you to-morrow," said
the doctor, on taking leave of the sham invalid.</p>

<p>"Oh! pray come back again to-day, for I feel
I require incessant watching and care."</p>

<p>The doctor promised, and returned in fact some
hours later.</p>

<p>He felt the pulse of the patient, and found it
still so high, that he recommended a severe regimen,
and the most absolute quiet and repose.</p>

<p>No sooner was the doctor gone, than Andréas
proceeded to take off a ligature, which he had
bound round his arm to increase the beating of his
pulse, and, whilst waiting for the return of his
victim, made a hearty meal.</p>

<p>Several days passed in this manner, during
which, Raymond never quitted the bedside of his
friend; he was as devoted as a Sister of Charity.
It was thought advisable under such serious circumstances,
to send for two other members of
the family, who were introduced to the doctor as
nephews of the sick man, but who were, in reality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
nothing more nor less than two sharpers, who were
brought from Paris to suit the purposes of the two
schemers, and were paid ten francs a day for their
services.</p>

<p>Their business was, to second and assist the
manœuvres of their master and chief.</p>

<p>The severity of the attack was overcome, and
Andréas appeared to be approaching convalescence.</p>

<p>To amuse the invalid, his two <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soi-disant</i>
nephews, and his friend, used to play at cards, at a
table placed close beside his bed.</p>

<p>The game was animated, and the gold coins were
rolling about on the floor. They were so rich in
this family!</p>

<p>"I say, doctor," exclaimed Andréas one evening,
"I think a game of cards would do me good, and go
far to restore me. You have a lucky face; will
you do me the kindness to hold a hand of cards
at écarté for me? I stake ten napoleons."</p>

<p>The doctor, to oblige his patient, as well as
to enjoy his favourite amusement, hastened to
comply.</p>

<p>He was most fortunate in the cards he held; he
won six consecutive times, and placed sixty napoleons
in the hands of his patient. "I am most
happy," added he, "in having so successfully performed
the mission you confided to me, but whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
it is your good luck, or mine, that has been the
cause of it, I cannot tell."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! Dear doctor," exclaimed
Andréas, "the only way to be certain of this, is to
play for yourself; I will bet on you, as I believe
you to be the lucky man."</p>

<p>The doctor did not require to be asked twice;
he played, and again had luck beyond belief. In
fact, in a short time he had won a hundred
napoleons (£80).</p>

<p>"You certainly bring me luck," said Andréas
to his partner; "but I have had enough for this
evening; I am tired and want repose."</p>

<p>"We hope that these gentlemen will forgive
us for winning and walking off with their money.
To-morrow, if you like, we will play again, and,
with your aid, I hope we shall clear out my two
nephews, which will, perhaps, cure them for their
passion for play. If you succeed, doctor, the cure
will be one of the best you have ever made."</p>

<p>It was not philanthropy, but his immense luck,
and love of gambling, which made the doctor keep
his appointment.</p>

<p>He came the next evening at the usual hour,
and found the nephews already there.</p>

<p>To fulfil his duties as physician, he felt the pulse
of his patient, and found him so much better, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
without more ado, he pronounced himself ready to
begin their game.</p>

<p>The table was placed, as on the previous evening,
close to the bedside of the patient, to enable
him to join in the amusement.</p>

<p>In order to plunder the poor doctor more
speedily, they allowed him at first to gain a few
napoleons.</p>

<p>This voluntary loss is in the language of sharpers
called the "bait," and allows them to double their
stakes without causing suspicion, enabling them to
gain their ends more easily and quickly.</p>

<p>As soon as the stakes rose, and the play was
for nothing less than bank-notes, the luck immediately
turned.</p>

<p>The doctor, hitherto so lucky, suddenly found
himself losing everything. At the end of the
evening, he was a loser to the extent of thirty
thousand francs (1200<i>l.</i>).</p>

<p>All along it is easy to perceive, there had been
but one victim. The losses of Andréas had been
but imaginary, and were only assumed, to prevent
suspicion on the part of his victim, and would
of course be returned to him by his accomplices.</p>

<p>Having bled the doctor as far as they could
venture to do (for he was not very wealthy), and
prudence also preventing their proceeding further,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
in case the police might put a finish to the scheme,
they thought it advisable to decamp.</p>

<p>The following morning, therefore, the invalid felt
himself sufficiently reinstated in health to prosecute
his long delayed journey, so, paying the doctor
for his attendance, he quitted the town as quickly
as possible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">The amateur of precious stones&mdash;What a beautiful diamond!&mdash;A
sovereign cure&mdash;Ah! if I were a rogue&mdash;A false paste ring!&mdash;The
game is played&mdash;The tell-tale stamp investigation&mdash;The wanderer

Rue de Jerusalem&mdash;Unexpected <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dénoûement</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was some time after this, that our two heroes
arrived at Lyons, and lost no time in making
inquiries regarding the various clubs in that town,
and the sort of people who were members of
them. Amongst others, one club was particularly
mentioned, in which most of the members were
gamblers.</p>

<p>They heard that a gentleman named Béroli
belonged to it, who was a great amateur in precious
stones.</p>

<p>Béroli had a mania for making clever bargains,
as he called them, which means, that he often
obtained a fine stone cheap, from those who were
not such great connoisseurs as himself.</p>

<p>Such transactions would be called cheating, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
that in these days, it is quite allowable, if not honest,
for buyers and sellers to try to take each other in.
Do we not daily hear a man boast of having, by
some deceit, obtained an article from a merchant at
cost price, whilst, on the other hand, the vendor
rubs his hands at having got rid of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">loup de
magasin</i>, as a faulty article is called.</p>

<p>In some commercial houses, it is stated, that a
premium is paid to the clerk, who disposes of the
<i>rococo</i> articles to some credulous customer.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Béroli's mania for precious
stones, put it into the head of Andréas to play
him a clever trick.</p>

<p>He requested Raymond to get himself introduced,
and work his way into the club, of which
Béroli was a member, whilst he (Andréas) went
to Paris, to arrange the preliminaries of an affair,
of which he at present refused to mention the
details, until all was in readiness for his great
<i>coup</i>. A fortnight afterwards, thanks to the
secret influence of Raymond, Andréas, who had
returned from Paris, was proposed and elected by
the club, of which his comrade was already a
member. The two Greeks were not supposed
to know one another, so each was able to proceed
with his work unsuspected.</p>

<p>Raymond ransacked the pockets of some rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
proprietors, whilst his comrade contented himself,
every evening, with playing a few innocent games
at écarté with Béroli, whose acquaintance he had
made.</p>

<p>The very first day, the amateur observed a
magnificent ring on the finger of Andréas.</p>

<p>"What a splendid diamond you have there,"
said Béroli, with an accent of envy.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," replied Andréas, carelessly, continuing
his play. "Diamonds are trumps. I cut, and
my turn-up card is worth nothing; you have the
trick."</p>

<p>Béroli, meanwhile, never took his eyes off the
precious stone, the dazzling lustre of which seemed
to fascinate him.</p>

<p>Each day brought forth fresh expressions of
admiration for the stone, to all of which, his opponent
apparently remained insensible.</p>

<p>One evening, Béroli was determined to force a
reply of some kind or other from Andréas.</p>

<p>"What did you pay for that stone?" said he.</p>

<p>"Are you serious in asking that question, do
you really wish to know?"</p>

<p>"Quite serious."</p>

<p>"Then I must explain, that, if I have not before
replied to your different exclamations of admiration,
it was because I thought you were joking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Now that I know the contrary, I feel bound to
tell you, that that superb diamond, which has
dazzled you so much, is only paste."</p>

<p>"How do you mean&mdash;paste?" said Béroli, with
an air of pique. "It is you that are joking."</p>

<p>"No; I assure you I am in earnest."</p>

<p>"Oh! nonsense; let me see it closer." Saying
these words, Béroli took up the hand of Andréas,
fixed his eyes on the ring, and kept turning it
about to make it glitter.</p>

<p>"You may tell others that it is false, but there
is no use in telling me so. I can assure you that
your stone is a real diamond.</p>

<p>"Very well; I am glad to hear it," rejoined
Andréas, feigning the greatest indifference. "Let
me see, it is your turn to play."</p>

<p>The two players continued their game, but
Béroli appeared <i>distrait</i>, and kept constantly
looking at the ring. At length he could no longer
restrain himself.</p>

<p>"So certain am I," exclaimed he, "that the
stone is of the first water, that I shall be happy
to purchase it, if you will let me."</p>

<p>"I will not sell it to you," replied Andréas.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because, in the first place, I do not want to
rob you of your money; and in the second, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
a family relic, which I do not wish to part with.
One of my uncles left it to me, and he had it
from his father. It has been in our family for a
hundred years, and is called "the paste ring." I
only wear it, because it is considered a charm
against headaches, to which I am very subject."</p>

<p>"But if I offered you a good price?" persisted
Béroli.</p>

<p>"If you offered me four times its value, I would
not part with it."</p>

<p>"Suppose I offered you, not four times, but
two or three hundred times, the value you set on
the stone?"</p>

<p>Andréas cut short all further colloquy by continuing
the game. "Diamonds," said he, "and
I have what they call '<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la fourchette</i>.' I mark
one."</p>

<p>As soon as the game was ended, Béroli, who
was very tenacious of his reputation as a connoisseur
in precious stones, returned to the charge.</p>

<p>"I am so sure of what I aver," continued he,
"that I shall always be ready to bargain for your
ring, whenever you wish to part with it."</p>

<p>"Ah! if I were a rogue," replied Tête d'Or, "I
should part with my paste ring to you, to prove
that you must not always be guided by your own
judgment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
"Stay," said Béroli, "will you lend me your
ring until to-morrow. To make quite sure, I will
just show it to a jeweller of my acquaintance."</p>

<p>Andréas acceded to his request with a show of
indifference, and they separated.</p>

<p>Béroli went off at once to his friend, to show
him the jewel, and ask him the value of it.</p>

<p>The jeweller, after examining it for some time
attentively, confirmed Béroli's opinion.</p>

<p>"This stone is of a most beautiful water," said
he, "and I should consider it cheap if I got it for
twelve thousand francs (480<i>l.</i>)."</p>

<p>The following day, Béroli advanced to Andréas
with an air of triumph.</p>

<p>"My dear sir," said he, "I can now state with
positive certainty, that your family has been in
error for the last hundred years about the value of
this ring. What you call paste, is a real diamond.
I will give you six thousand francs for it."</p>

<p>To this offer Andréas made no reply.</p>

<p>They sat down to play, but during the game, the
indefatigable Béroli incessantly returned to the
charge, offering each time a higher price for the
ring, to tempt his adversary, and finally made him
an offer of nine thousand francs. To all of which
Andréas remained silent, contenting himself by
shaking his head each time in token of negative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
It was late, and the party was on the point of
breaking up, when Béroli suddenly made up his
mind.</p>

<p>"Stop," he exclaimed, at the same time placing
ten bank-notes, of a thousand francs each, on the
table. "This is my last offer. Say yes, and the
bargain is struck."</p>

<p>"You are resolved to cheat yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," replied the amateur, in a bantering
tone, looking again intently on the ring, which
he had kept on his finger throughout the evening.</p>

<p>"Well, if you insist on it, you shall have it;
only allow me to take out from a secret recess the
lock of hair of my worthy uncle, who has been the
means of making me get ten thousand francs. I
certainly did not anticipate this great good luck.
See what it is to be a connoisseur. Here; here is
your ring. Thanks."</p>

<p>Early the following day, Béroli again went to
his friend the jeweller. "I've got that splendid
diamond," said he, addressing him. "Look
here; see how beautiful it is! I am sure, that
whenever I wish to part with it, I shall always
get more than what you offered me."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" responded the jeweller,
taking up the ring, to look more closely at it.</p>

<p>"Stay; what's this?" he exclaimed. "What's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
this you have brought to show me? This a
diamond! why, it is nothing but paste!"</p>

<p>The trick was played, and had succeeded.
Under pretence of taking out his uncle's hair,
Andréas had cleverly changed the diamond ring, for
a paste one precisely similar, which he had had
made for the express purpose.</p>

<p>On the following day, the ingenious and clever
thief was far away, out of reach of Béroli and all
chance of redress.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>"Those who are unacquainted with the perseverance
and energy of Béroli," observed Raymond,
in relating this anecdote to me, "may fancy that
the diamond ring is lost to him for ever. Not so."</p>

<p>The amateur, after having been so cruelly deceived,
took an oath that he would discover, and be revenged
on, his enemy.</p>

<p>On examining the false ring, Béroli first made
sure that it bore the goldsmith's mark, proving it
to be of pure gold. This was not much consolation,
still, it led him to suppose, that the real
diamond ring must also, of course, bear the same
stamp.</p>

<p>If, muttered Béroli to himself, the two rings have
passed through the comptroller's hands, the stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
are so large, and of such value, that it is next to
impossible he did not remark them.</p>

<p>This simple reflection, was the first step towards
the discovery of the real gem.</p>

<p>Furnished with a letter of introduction from his
friend, the jeweller, Béroli proceeds to Paris, goes
straight to the mint, and presents the ring to the
comptroller, who perfectly remembers the two rings
in question, and gives the address of the jeweller
who manufactured them.</p>

<p>From the latter Béroli learns, that his customer,
Andréas, lives at No. 13, Rue Cadet.</p>

<p>Any one else would have handed Andréas over
to the police; but caring much more to obtain
possession of his ring, than to satisfy the ends of
justice, Béroli thinks it more prudent to take the
affair into his own hands, and manage it in his own
way.</p>

<p>He goes to the concierge, in the Rue Cadet,
and slipping a napoleon into his hand, begins by
relating to him a romantic tale, well calculated to
impose on the man, and make him tell all he wished
to know.</p>

<p>Béroli says, that a daughter of a friend of his,
residing in the country, has been asked in marriage
by his tenant, M. Andréas, and that he has come
to find out all he can about him, believing that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
could not go to a better source than his friend the
concierge.</p>

<p>The man, delighted at the affable manners of his
interlocutor, as well as flattered at the confidence
reposed in him, reveals, under the seal of secresy,
that Andréas has a mistress living with him, and
that he often remains from home all night.</p>

<p>This is enough for Béroli; he takes leave of his
obliging informant, and, that very evening, places
himself as a spy at the gate of his deceiver.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock at night, Andréas comes out, and
directs his steps towards an isolated house, at the
end of the Rue Pigale.</p>

<p>Béroli follows him, and sees him, and about
twenty other men, go into the same house.</p>

<p>Hidden in a doorway close by, Béroli observes
all that goes on without being himself seen. He
remarks, that every time the bell of the gate is
rung, the door is opened by a servant with a light
in his hand, who makes a close inspection of the
person presenting himself, before he admits him.</p>

<p>The mystery attending the meeting, the absence
of a concierge, &amp;c., all lead Béroli to conclude, that
this must be one of the secret gambling houses;
and what confirms him still more in this opinion,
is, that though there are four windows in each
story, in the front of the house, not one of them is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
illuminated. Any one would have supposed it to
be uninhabited.</p>

<p>Wishing to have a yet more convincing proof of
the correctness of his surmises, he determines to
wait until the meeting is over, and employs himself,
whilst waiting, in concocting his plan of attack.</p>

<p>About four o'clock in the morning, the door
again opens, and a man, after looking up and down
the street in a mysterious manner, issues out.</p>

<p>Béroli suddenly confronts him.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, quickly, so as to give him no
time for reflection, "is everybody gone out of this
house?"</p>

<p>"Why?" asks the unknown.</p>

<p>"Because the police are close by, and will soon
surround it. I came to warn one of my friends,
who was to have spent the night here."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the information," replies the unknown,
proceeding on his way.</p>

<p>If, thought Béroli, this man be only one of the
dupes, he would have nothing to fear, as he has
quitted the gambling house; but his anxiety to be
off, proves that he fears the vigilance of the police,
so I feel sure he must be one of the gang.</p>

<p>Full of this idea, Béroli follows at a little distance,
and when he sees him slacken his pace, he goes up
to him, and thus addresses <span class="locked">him:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
"I beg your pardon for having made you race
in this manner, by giving you false information, but
I wished to find out if you were one of us, and I
have succeeded in so doing."</p>

<p>"Will you explain yourself, sir, if you please, for
I do not understand what you mean."</p>

<p>"I can easily make you comprehend me, by
simply stating that I am the colleague of Andréas."</p>

<p>"What has that got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"I wish to make a proposition to you. Would
you like to gain two thousand francs without any
trouble?".</p>

<p>"Explain yourself."</p>

<p>"Since you say you know Andréas&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, I did not say that."</p>

<p>"Since you know him, I must inform you, that
that scamp has played me a most infamous trick."</p>

<p>"He is quite capable of so doing," added the
unknown, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I wish to be revenged, and that is why I ask
you to assist me."</p>

<p>"What is there for me to do?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely anything. It is only necessary for
you to bring Andréas to a house, which I shall point
out to you, under pretext of introducing him into
a club, where he will find several victims to dupe.
I'll arrange all the rest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
"I am ready," replied the unknown. "When
and where is it to be?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, at No. 22, Rue Meslay, on the
second floor."</p>

<p>The following morning, the new associate of Béroli
called on Andréas, to make the perfidious proposition
to him.</p>

<p>Never doubting his comrade, Andréas accepted
the proposal, thinking to make an excellent <i>coup</i>,
the more so, as things were going on rather badly
in the Rue Pigale.</p>

<p>That very evening, the two Greeks proceeded to
the house indicated by Béroli, in the Rue Meslay.</p>

<p>A servant in livery, having admitted them,
opened the doors of a drawing-room brilliantly
illuminated.</p>

<p>Andréas entered first, without apprehension, but
he had no sooner done so, than his companion,
following the instructions he had received from
Béroli, turned round suddenly, and locked the door.</p>

<p>At the same moment, Béroli, and two athletic-looking
men, entered from a door on the opposite
side of the room.</p>

<p>"You, doubtless, remember me," exclaimed
Béroli, in an austere and determined voice. "You
must know what it is that brings me here."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir," cried Andréas, feigning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the greatest indignation. "First of all, answer
me. What sort of ambush is this, into which you
have entrapped me? Am I in the midst of thieves,
or assassins?"</p>

<p>"Do not speak so loud, sir," replied Béroli,
"or you may have reason to regret it. The ambush
of which you complain is only a favour to you&mdash;a
step towards an amicable settlement of the
business."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by talking to me about
favours?" replied Andréas, "and what do you
complain of? You offered me ten thousand francs
for a ring, and I accepted your offer. Did I not
give you the ring?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did, but you omit to mention, that
the stone you gave me was a false one."</p>

<p>"Ah! Mon Dieu!" coolly replied Andréas. "I
am far from denying it. I repeated that to you so
often, that you must recollect it. Besides, did you
not, when paying me the ten thousand francs, say
you knew the stone was false, but that you very
much wished to possess it?"</p>

<p>"Do not let us play upon words, sir, but let us
come to the point. You are going to give me the
ring you cheated me out of."</p>

<p>"To avoid all discussion on the subject, I tell
you, once for all, that I have never had any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
ring in my possession, than the one I delivered to
you."</p>

<p>"If that be the case, you will not mind copying
this, and sending it to your mistress?"</p>

<p>"Let me see what it's about," said Andréas,
taking the paper from Béroli. He read as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dearest</span>,&mdash;I hope to make some money
in the house from which I pen these lines, but I
require my diamond ring for the affair. Bring it
to me yourself, to the address I enclose, and do not
entrust it to any one else. The bearer of this note
will give you my keys. At eleven o'clock precisely,
I shall be at the door awaiting you. Take a carriage,
so as to be punctual.</p>

<p class="sigright">
"<span class="smcap">Andréas.</span>
</p>

<p class="p0">
"22, Rue Meslay."
</p></blockquote>

<p>"Nothing will induce me to write that,"
exclaimed Andréas.</p>

<p>"I will not solicit you long," said Béroli. "Will
you do it, Yes or No?"</p>

<p>"No, a thousand times, no!"</p>

<p>"Baptiste, go and bring the commissary of
police," said Béroli, addressing the man on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
right. "Go at once, and do not return without
him."</p>

<p>"A moment," supplicated Andréas, making a
sign to the commissionnaire to stop. "Let us see
if we cannot arrange this business; what will you
take to end the affair?"</p>

<p>"I will have no arrangements; I require nothing,
but that you should copy and sign this letter."</p>

<p>Seeing there was nothing for it but to agree
to Béroli's proposal, Andréas began to think,
how he could manage to decamp with the ring,
as soon as he received it from the hands of his
mistress.</p>

<p>So, seating himself at the table, on which all
the implements for writing had been previously
prepared, and under the eye of Béroli, he copied
the missive word for word.</p>

<p>Two hours afterwards, Andréas was set at
liberty, and Béroli had obtained possession of the
celebrated ring.</p>

<p>This is how it was managed:</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chère amie</i> of Andréas, on receiving his
note, hastened in a carriage to the house he had
indicated, taking the ring with her; but no sooner
did the carriage stop at the door of No. 22, Rue
Meslay, than a commissary of police, with his
badge of office (the scarf), and accompanied by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
sergent-de-ville, opened the door of the carriage
and got in, directing the coachman to go to the
prefecture of police in the Rue de Jerusalem.</p>

<p>On their way thither, the commissary explained
to the fair messenger, that, having been ordered
by the police to keep a watch on No. 22, Rue
Meslay, he stopped a man coming out of that
house, who was the bearer of a letter, and that
after reading the contents of it, he had substituted
one of the police for the original messenger.</p>

<p>"The law has seized all the property which was
in that house, and I am under the painful necessity,
madam," continued he, "of arresting you,
as being a party concerned in a serious robbery.
Allow me to take charge of this article, which
otherwise you might make away with." Thus
saying, the officer drew the diamond ring from
the finger of the lady, though not without some
resistance on her part.</p>

<p>The clock of the Palais de Justice was striking
midnight, as the carriage drove up to the gate.
The night was pitch dark.</p>

<p>"We must ring up the concierge to open the
gate," observed the commissary to the sergent-de-ville;
at the same time they both got out, and
shut the door of the carriage with assiduous care.</p>

<p>Two minutes had scarcely elapsed, when a loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
voice exclaimed, "You cannot remain opposite this
gate, coachman."</p>

<p>"I know that," replied that individual, "but I
am waiting for orders. You have not told me
where to drive to, Ma'am," added he, putting
down one of the glasses. "Where am I to drive
you to?"</p>

<p>"Where are you to drive me? To the Rue
Cadet, where you took me up," said the fair
occupant of the carriage, in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>"Go along, my hearties," exclaimed the Jehu,
whipping up his horses, "this is my last fare to-night."</p>

<p>If my readers have not already guessed as much,
I will mention for their edification, that the commissary
of police and his assistant, were neither
more nor less than two of Béroli's friends; and
that, instead of ringing up the concierge, as they
had stated, favoured by the darkness of the night,
they made off, as quickly as they could, carrying
the precious ring, which they soon afterwards
delivered into the hands of Béroli.</p>

<p>The Society of Philosophers generally made
Calais the centre of their operations, for the
reason that they were often summoned by Achille
Chauvignac, who, as my readers may remember,
had been the originator of the plot at St.
Omer.</p>

<p>Chauvignac was especially indefatigable in such
affairs, as, without running the slightest risk, he
always shared largely in the profits of these
transactions.</p>

<p>So unprincipled was he, that he continually
selected his most intimate friends for his victims.</p>

<p>Each gambler was classed as to his means, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
also, as to whether he was likely to allow himself
to be plucked without remonstrance.</p>

<p>Thus, M. B&mdash; was valued at three thousand
francs; M. P&mdash; at six thousand; M. C&mdash; was not
worth much, being a bad player; but, at any rate,
they put him down at a thousand francs.</p>

<p>The one who was considered the best, that is,
the richest dupe, was M. F&mdash;, who was estimated
at from fifteen to twenty thousand francs.</p>

<p>Andréas and Raymond had gone the round of
all the clubs of Calais and Boulogne, but they
dared not venture to St. Omer, for fear of being
recognised. They sent, in their place, however,
two clever sharpers, who originally came from
Venice, which city was formerly supposed to be the
cradle of roguery.</p>

<p>The Society of Philosophers would not certainly
have placed the implicit confidence they did, in
these two delegates, had it not been, that they were
under the immediate <i>surveillance</i> of Chauvignac,
who not only looked after them himself, but
arranged a system of <i>espionnage</i> between the
two Greeks, so that each of them was overlooked
by his companion. His plan was, to address one
of them privately thus:</p>

<p>"Do you know, I have not much confidence in
your friend; I much fear he will impose on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
society; just take a note of his winnings, and
watch him. You shall not go unrewarded for this
service."</p>

<p>He then went and said precisely the same thing
to the other, so that without being aware of it, each
Greek was watched by his comrade.</p>

<p>The harvest reaped by the society at St. Omer,
was very productive, but the largest share went
into the pocket of Chauvignac, who, as may be
conceived, was not very particular in the just division
of the money entrusted to him.</p>

<p>Whether it was in consequence of this affair, or
from some trifling indiscretion on the part of the
philosophers, the credit of Chauvignac seemed on
the decline. Every one was astonished to see the
money he spent,&mdash;a man who had literally nothing&mdash;and
then his constant trips to Paris, without any
obvious reason, and his intimacy with men whose
characters were not unsullied&mdash;all these circumstances
combined to make honest men rather shun
his society.</p>

<p>Chauvignac was as clever as he was unprincipled;
for the latter quality does not prevent a
man from possessing talent; the best proof of
which is, that a rogue is seldom a fool.</p>

<p>Chauvignac was sharp enough, soon to discover
the discredit into which he had fallen, and knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
how prejudicial it would prove to his interests, he
immediately set about thinking, how he could reestablish
himself in the good graces of society.</p>

<p>Amongst the young fools who shared with him
a life of dissipation, he had formed a small club, at
the head of which was a young man named Olivier
de X&mdash;&mdash;, who was noted for his elegance and
his eccentricities.</p>

<p>The family of this wild young fellow, was one of
the oldest and most respectable in the country, and
much looked-up to.</p>

<p>Chauvignac fixed on this young heir, as a means
of regaining his place in the good opinion of his
fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>He affected to be on terms of the greatest
intimacy with him, when he met him in public
places, and addressed him in a loud tone of voice,
in the most familiar manner.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, this apparent intimacy with
Olivier, had just the contrary result to what
Chauvignac had anticipated: the one lost position,
but the other did not gain it.</p>

<p>Olivier began to be shunned, but Chauvignac
fared no better. The latter, however, as soon as
he perceived this, and he was not long in so doing,
bethought himself of making Olivier's credit subservient
to his views in another way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
The parents of Olivier were not wealthy, and
could do nothing for their son, so his excessive
extravagance had brought him into difficulties and
debt.</p>

<p>He regarded Chauvignac with envy and admiration;
he saw him living like a prince, without any
creditors to annoy him.</p>

<p>"How is it," said he to Chauvignac one day,
"that you, who have no fortune, can gratify all your
tastes and fancies, whilst I, who have some small
means, am obliged to be economical, besides which,
I am in debt?"</p>

<p>This query was precisely what Chauvignac had
been waiting for. He remained, for some moments,
without answering his questioner, intending to
give more effect to his words; then, with a
diabolical smile, he thus addressed him:</p>

<p>"Would you like to be as happy as I am?"</p>

<p>"Can you ask me?"</p>

<p>"All depends on yourself, to be even better off
than I am."</p>

<p>"What must I do?" eagerly demanded Olivier.</p>

<p>Chauvignac thought his young neophyte
sufficiently prepared, to receive what he had to
impart.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," whispered he, in a mysterious
voice. "You have doubtless heard the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
proverb, old as the world itself: Men are divided
into two classes, Dupers and Dupes. Come, speak
frankly, to which of these categories would you like
to belong?"</p>

<p>"Why you see, you are so abrupt in your question.
You come on one so suddenly; it requires
reflection."</p>

<p>"Agreed," observed this second Mephistophiles,
"we will make the reflections together, and will
study the subject, in some individuals of that
great and motley crowd, which is termed 'society.'"</p>

<p>The two friends were, at that moment, standing
at the door of one of the largest and best cafés in
the town.</p>

<p>It was Sunday; the weather was fine, and
crowds of pedestrians were lounging up and down
before them.</p>

<p>"Look," said Chauvignac, "do you see that
thin miserable man, with his head bowed down,
and his clothes hanging in rags? He is an
unfortunate fellow, who has worked all his life to
pay off the debts left by his father. He is old: he
has hardly bread to put in his mouth. You will
observe no one takes any notice of him. Now,
look at that stout man, so puffed up with pride and
insolence; how pleased he seems with himself, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
they say, like a peacock spreading his tail. He has
been a merchant, and has made his money by fraud
and cheating. He afterwards set up as a banker,
and lent money at an usurious interest. He is
now a millionnaire. See&mdash;he bows with a patronising
air to all whom he meets. The first is a
dupe, the second a duper."</p>

<p>"Or to speak more plainly," added Olivier, "the
first is an honest man, the second a rogue."</p>

<p>"Be it so&mdash;I grant you that," continued the
tempter, "but now I will give you another example,
of which you will not be able to make the same
observation.</p>

<p>"You, better than any one else, ought to know
an intelligent, generous-hearted, and ambitious
young man, who, for want of sufficient means, leads
a life of privation and troubles, is overwhelmed
with debt, and, if he thinks of playing to retrieve
his fortunes, he is sure to lose. Near to him, at
this moment, is one of his friends, who, without
fixed income or expectations, possesses, nevertheless,
a never ending fortune. This man always
wins at play, and has not a caprice ungratified.</p>

<p>"The former of these is the dupe, the latter
&mdash;&mdash; is &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Chauvignac paused, to allow Olivier to
finish the phrase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
"What is it you mean?" asked he, beginning to
comprehend the purport of the conversation.</p>

<p>"What I mean, is this," replied Chauvignac with
a sneer&mdash;"To prove to you, that the lucky
gamester, whose good fortune you envy, belongs to
a society of philosophers, and that these philosophers
have certain and easy methods, of turning
luck in their own favour."</p>

<p>"But," observed Olivier, his sense of right struggling
for mastery in his mind. "To cheat at play
is an act of dishonesty."</p>

<p>"On this point, my dear sir, we do not agree;
you are in error, and I will prove it to you. First
of all, tell me what you call cheating at play?"</p>

<p>"I call winning by underhand tricks, cheating."</p>

<p>"Very well; if that be the case, I will soon
show you that the most honest man will not scruple
to cheat.</p>

<p>"For instance, do we not daily see men of the
strictest probity, seek to turn luck in their favour
by various means. One, in placing himself at the
table, will sit opposite the hinges, because he
believes it to be a lucky spot. Again, if he wins,
he will not count his money, fearing to turn his
luck. Another believes in the influence of a certain
coin, which he mixes with the rest of his money&mdash;but
which he will never part with. Others, again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
wear amulets, made of the dried heart of a black
hen, the head of a beetle, or a bit of the cord with
which a malefactor has been <span class="locked">hung.<a name="FNanchor_G" id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a></span></p>

<p>"Just tell me what is the object of these mysterious
influences, if it be not, as they say in the
criminal courts, "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gagner subrepticement le bien
d'autrui en faisant tourner à son profit les bénéfices
d'une partie</i>.</p>

<p>"In such cases, if the act is not committed, the
intention is the same, and ought to be considered
as if accomplished.</p>

<p>"Between the above-mentioned actions and ours,
the only difference is, that one depends on the
mind, the other on the fingers. The moral result
is the same.</p>

<p>"Of this you may be sure, that if these honest
folks do not go further, it is because they dare
not. I will even say more," continued Chauvignac,
carried away by his own sophistry. "Take, for
instance, one of these heroes of probity, and
show him a method of always winning, with a
certainty of never being detected, and see if he
will not follow it. Believe me, I know a great
deal more than I care to tell."</p>

<p>"All that," said Olivier, "proves, at most, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
all honest men may not be able to resist temptation;
but it does not go to prove, that cheating is
not a crime. Besides, it is punishable by law."</p>

<p>"That's true," replied the cunning Chauvignac;
"but again, we have no proof that the law is right.
I maintain, that, far from being reprehensible, the
art of turning aside ill-luck and bettering one's
fortune, is a thing which ought to be encouraged."</p>

<p>Olivier could not help smiling.</p>

<p>"I am serious," added Chauvignac. "Yes!
The art of winning at play is meritorious. And
why? Because it is useful. If the Government
had any sense, they would not only encourage
cheating, but give a premium for it."</p>

<p>"Then I don't know what morality means."</p>

<p>"Only, because you have not studied pure philosophy,
as I have. Hold&mdash;to make you understand
it better, I will just give you an example.</p>

<p>"How often do we hear of deaths caused by
eating mushrooms! Well, if people imagined that
all mushrooms were poisonous, of course no one
would venture to partake of them.</p>

<p>"It is the same with gambling; if people expected
to lose every time they played, few would run the
risk of trusting to their luck at cards, and play
would become what it ought to be, a mere relaxation
and amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
"Thus the Greeks would have done more for
morality, than all the moralists in the world.</p>

<p>"Therefore, I confess to you, that I, who would not
rob any one of a pin, have not only no scruple in
doing my best to control fate, but, in cheating, I
think I carry out a principle, eminently useful to
humanity.</p>

<p>"The art of cheating at play, is to me only high
philosophy put in practice."</p>

<p>Young Olivier had listened with the most intense
interest, to the eloquent pleading of his friend in
favour of cheating, and it was easy to perceive, that
his feelings of probity on the subject, were giving
way before the subtle sophistry of the tempter, and
that he already began to approve of some of the
arguments he had heard in its favour.</p>

<p>Chauvignac perceived it, and wishing to continue
his work of <span class="locked">evil&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Let us see," added he, in an insinuating manner,
"what have we to weigh in your own case?
On the one hand, wealth, pleasure, and enjoyment of
every description; on the other hand, hard-hearted
creditors, misery, and ruin."</p>

<p>"But," observed Olivier at length, quite carried
away in spite of himself, "one might be discovered,
and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How weak and childish you are!&mdash;Here, come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
into this café with me, and you shall see how easily
these things are done.</p>

<p>"You see yonder big Benoit, with his small
annuity. I am going to propose a game of piquet
to him, and make him pay for a cup of coffee for
each of us. 'Tis a pity he has not more to lose."</p>

<p>Benoit is accosted by these gentlemen. The
game and the stake are accepted: the result is not
long delayed. In two hands the game was over.
Chauvignac and his friend left the café, and once in
the street, the former put the finishing stroke to his
unworthy maxims.</p>

<p>"There, it is not difficult, you observe," said he.
"Oh! how delightful it is to be able to wrestle with
fate, by fleecing a set of simpletons, whom that
capricious Dame Fortune loves so often to favour."</p>

<p>"Does it take long to learn?" said Olivier, quite
bewildered with all he had seen and heard.</p>

<p>"That depends upon circumstances," replied his
perfidious friend; "it is with this art, as with the
piano, one can soon give pleasure; it depends on
the professor, and his method of teaching.</p>

<p>"But, as we are not far from where I live, come
in; and whilst we smoke a cigar together, I'll explain
a few things to you."</p>

<p>Olivier still rather hesitated to follow him.</p>

<p>"Oh! nonsense! it binds you to nothing; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
can do just as you please. It is as well to know
a little of everything, and at all events, if you do
not like to practise the system yourself, it will
put you on your guard when attacked. One never
knows what may happen."</p>

<p>Chauvignac would certainly not have taken so
much trouble about the matter, if he had not had
in view some act of treachery towards his companion.
The conversation ended by Olivier accepting
the offer held out to him.</p>

<p>Behold them now, seated on a sofa, each with a
cigar in his mouth, and Chauvignac with a pack of
cards in his hand.</p>

<p>"Look! here is a hand, tell me if you see any
signs of cheating in any of the cards?"</p>

<p>The novice examined the cards with great attention,
but not being an adept in the art, failed to
discover anything.</p>

<p>"You observe nothing in this hand of cards?"
said Chauvignac. "They have, however, been subjected
to a process that we call <span class="locked">biseautage,<a name="FNanchor_H" id="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">H</a></span> or
having one end made narrower than the other.
This system shows the player what cards he is to
retain, and how to class them, in the order he
requires for playing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Chauvignac, joining precept to example, showed
his friend the way it was to be done.</p>

<p>"Now," added he, "to prove to you that this
trick is not difficult, I will make you do it yourself.
Let us sit down at this table, and suppose we are
playing for a thousand francs."</p>

<p>Although Olivier had no great talent for sleight
of hand, he succeeded in learning from his friend
how to gain the whole of the five tricks, twice
running, at écarté.</p>

<p>"This trick," said Chauvignac to him, "is one
of the first, as well as the most easy, in the art of
cheating. In a little while, I shall teach you how
to play with prepared cards, and you will, in time,
I hope, become an accomplished philosopher."</p>

<p>Olivier made no reply, his mind was in a perfect
state of chaos, from the thousand and one thoughts
which filled it.</p>

<p>The tempter, judging his victim to be now
sufficiently compromised, left him to the temptations
which he had suggested to him. He made
the excuse of having some visits to pay, and the
two friends separated.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards the Professor went to see
his pupil.</p>

<p>"Would you like to join me," asked he, "in
a little tour of pleasure I am about to make?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
"Your kind proposal is badly timed," replied
Olivier. "I am not only without funds just now,
but I am trying to obtain a thousand francs, to pay
a cursed bill of exchange that I signed, and which
falls due this very day."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said Chauvignac, taking a banknote
for the amount out of his pocket-book&mdash;"Here
it is; but mind, you must return it to me to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You are deranged."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am, but in my insanity, I am mad
enough to offer you another thousand francs, to
enable you to go and secure thirty thousand which
are awaiting you."</p>

<p>"Pray explain yourself, or else you will turn my
brain also!"</p>

<p>"Listen: if ever there was a desperate gambler,
it is the Count de Vandermool, a rich Belgian
capitalist, and who can well afford to lose a hundred
thousand francs (4000<i>l.</i>). He is just now in
Boulogne, and intends remaining there a week.
We must bleed this millionnaire; nothing will be
more easy, as a friend and colleague of mine from
Paris, named Chaffard, is already acquainted with
him, so all we have to do is to set to work at once.</p>

<p>"You are now one of us. That is well understood,
is it not? In a short time you will be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
to satisfy your creditors, and to give your mistress
a Cashmere shawl."</p>

<p>"But you go too quick," said Olivier in a wavering
tone. "Wait a bit, I have not yet said yes."</p>

<p>"I don't ask you to say 'yes' now, you shall
say it at Boulogne&mdash;make haste, and go and pay
your bill; we shall leave this in two hours. The
post-horses are ordered, we shall start from my
house&mdash;be punctual."</p>

<p>The same evening the two philosophers arrive
at Boulogne. They alight at the Hôtel de
L'Univers, which has been selected for them by
their accomplice&mdash;by whom they are shortly
welcomed.</p>

<p>He tells them they have no time to lose, as the
Count has spoken of quitting Boulogne the following
day.</p>

<p>The travellers swallow a hasty dinner, make
some slight toilette, and bend their steps towards
the apartment occupied by the Count, preceded by
Chaffard, who introduces them as two friends of
his, who have estates in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The Count de Vandermool is a man about fifty
years of age, he has an open and pleasing countenance;
on his breast hang several foreign
decorations.</p>

<p>The new arrivals are received by him with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
most flattering cordiality; he does more; he
invites them to spend the evening with him.</p>

<p>The invitation, it is needless to say, is accepted.
The conversation, at first animated, begins to flag
a little. The Count proposes a game of cards,
which proposal is also eagerly accepted by the
three confederates.</p>

<p>Whilst the tables are being arranged, Chauvignac
gave his young friend two packs of cards,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">biseautées</i>, to be substituted for those which should
be produced by the Count.</p>

<p>Écarté was the game fixed on, and Olivier was
selected to play with the Belgian; the two others
having pretended not to know the game, contented
themselves by betting one against the other&mdash;as
their interests were in common, it was of little
consequence which won the bet.</p>

<p>Olivier was at first thunderstruck at the assertion
of his two friends, that they did not know how to
play, but from certain telegraphic signs they made
to him, he discovered that it was to prevent
suspicion, in case he should win.</p>

<p>The wealthy Count would only play for bank-notes.
"Metal," he said, "has not an agreeable
odour in a drawing-room."</p>

<p>The young novice, at first confused by being a
party to such a snare, neglected for a time to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
advantage of the prepared cards, and following the
dictates of his conscience, trusted to the chances of
fortune.</p>

<p>The capricious goddess, far from being grateful
for his trust, forsook him.</p>

<p>In two hands, the only thousand-franc note he
possessed fell into the hands of his opponent.</p>

<p>Now it is, that, pressed on by the glances of
Chauvignac, as well as anxious to regain his loss,
Olivier essays some of the manœuvres which his
friend had taught him.</p>

<p>They were easy to execute, for the Count was so
near-sighted, that his nose was almost buried in
his cards.</p>

<p>Of course the luck now turned, and the bank-notes
began to accumulate beside Olivier, who, elated
with his success, was indefatigable in his work.</p>

<p>The Count Vandermool was a good-tempered
player. His repeated losses did not make him lose
his jovial good-humour.</p>

<p>To look at his happy countenance, you would
certainly have thought he was the winner.</p>

<p>"I am not in a lucky vein," observed he, good-naturedly,
taking a pinch of snuff from a superb
gold snuff-box. "In this last trick, I vainly hoped
to gain all, and I've got nothing."</p>

<p>Olivier was serious, his mind was not in a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
to talk lightly. He continued to handle his cards
with feverish eagerness.</p>

<p>Not wishing, however, to seem wanting in politeness
towards so noble a host&mdash;"You are admirable
to-night," said he to him with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"'Admirable,' do you say&mdash;Yes, yes, Monsieur
Olivier, that's the word. I wish you joy. Go on;
give me some cards!"</p>

<p>"It is useless to go on. Trump, and then trump.
I cut, and it is the king of diamonds, which stands
good&mdash;this gives me the five points."</p>

<p>"Ah! ill-luck has certainly fastened on me this
evening," said the Count, "that makes eighty
thousand francs I have lost; I see I shall soon
make up the hundred thousand.</p>

<p>"I think it right to tell you, that I never go
beyond that sum, and that if I am to lose it, I shall
propose having some supper before I lose my last
twenty thousand. Perhaps, that may change my
luck; you certainly owe me this much."</p>

<p>The proposition to sup, met with general approbation.</p>

<p>Olivier, almost out of his wits with joy, at becoming
the possessor of eighty thousand francs, could not
resist the impulse he felt to testify his feelings of
gratitude to Chauvignac. He drew him aside, and
shook him warmly by the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
The wretched man had no idea of the cruel
deception which had been practised on him, and
which had all been pre-arranged by his two
comrades.</p>

<p>The rich Belgian capitalist, the respectable count,
was no other than a clever Parisian sharper, whom
Chauvignac had persuaded to come, for the express
purpose of ruining the unfortunate young man,
who never perceived, whilst his back was turned,
that the count changed the two packs of clipped
cards which they had hitherto used, for two packs
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">biseautées</i> in the contrary way.</p>

<p>During supper they drank but little, wishing to
keep their heads clear. The meal, nevertheless,
was very merry; and as soon as it was over, they
recommenced playing.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Parisian sharper, seating himself
at the table, "I wish to end this affair one way or
other, quickly. Let us make the stake twenty
thousand francs (800<i>l.</i>)."</p>

<p>Olivier, after having won so largely, could not
but accept the proposition. It was only just
towards his adversary. But, oh! cruel deception!
the stake of twenty thousand francs, on which
Olivier had so surely counted, passed into the
hands of his opponent.</p>

<p>A stake of forty thousand francs shared the fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
of its predecessor. Breathless, bewildered, and
discouraged, Olivier knew not what to do. In vain
he manipulated the cards; he got none but the
lowest, whilst his adversary had all the trumps in
his hand; and as it was Olivier who dealt them to
him, he could not complain.</p>

<p>In his despair, he looked enquiringly at Chauvignac,
who made signs to him to go on.</p>

<p>Distracted, and quite beside himself, the poor
victim continued to stake enormous sums; and, in
his turn, shortly owed his adversary a hundred
thousand francs.</p>

<p>The pretended count then gave up playing, folded
his arms, and thus addressed Olivier:</p>

<p>"M. Olivier de X&mdash;&mdash;," said he, in a stern tone
of voice, "you must be very well off, to stake such
sums; but be careful, for, rich as you are, you
must be aware, that if people lose a hundred
thousand francs, they must also pay them, as I
did.</p>

<p>"So now, just pay me the sum you have lost,
and then we'll go on playing."</p>

<p>"That's only fair, sir," muttered young Olivier;
"I am willing to satisfy your demands, but you
know that gambling debts ... my word...."</p>

<p>"Devil take it, sir," exclaimed the count, giving
the table a violent blow with his fist. "What's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
that you say about your word? It well becomes
you to talk of debts of honour. We'll play, if you
please, another kind of game, and let us put things
as they really are. M. Olivier de X&mdash;&mdash;, you are a
knave! Yes; a knave! The cards you have been
using are clipped; and it is you who have brought
them here."</p>

<p>"Sir, you insult me."</p>

<p>"You don't say so, sir," said the count, ironically.</p>

<p>"Sir, this is too much&mdash;I demand satisfaction
for this&mdash;and that immediately. Do you hear, sir?
let us go, and settle it at once."</p>

<p>"No, no, let us remain here, and settle <i>this</i> affair
of honour. Stay, your two friends will be your
witnesses, and I will send to some of my friends, to
come and be mine."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the sharper uttered these words,
than he got up, and rang violently.</p>

<p>His servant answered the bell.</p>

<p>"Go to the Procureur du Roi, and ask him to
come here at once, on an affair of great importance;
make haste, do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Pardon! sir, pardon! Do not ruin me," said
the unhappy Olivier, in a tone of supplication. "I
throw myself on your mercy."</p>

<p>"Étienne, mind you wait outside that door, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
if, in ten minutes, you do not receive orders to the
contrary you will do as I told you."</p>

<p>"Now then, sir," continued the count, turning
to Olivier, "I will talk to you. These cards have
been substituted by you in the place of those which
I had provided. I insist upon your making these
cards up in a packet, and sealing them with the
ring on your finger, which bears your crest and
coat of arms."</p>

<p>In vain Olivier looked from one to the other;
neither Chauvignac nor Chaffard gave him any
encouragement, but looked at him as much as to
say, there was nothing for it but to do as he was
desired.</p>

<p>Olivier obeyed.</p>

<p>As soon as the demand had been complied with,
the pretended Belgian again attacked him. "Besides,
this is not all, sir; I have fairly won my
money, and you will give me a guarantee that it
will be paid to me. You will give me bills at sight
for the sum of one hundred thousand francs which
you owe me."</p>

<p>The unhappy Olivier hesitating to comply with
this demand, his implacable creditor rose and seized
the bell.</p>

<p>"Oh! do not ring, sir&mdash;do not ring," said the
young man, "I will sign the paper."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
And he signed it.</p>

<p>The villainous plot was consummated.</p>

<p>Olivier returned to his family, and humbly confessed
all that he had done.</p>

<p>His old father, rather than bring disgrace on his
child, paid the money, esteeming his son's honour
beyond all price.</p>

<p>The Society of Philosophers had shared in this
roguery, in the persons of Chaffard and the Belgian
capitalist.</p>

<p>To Chaffard was delegated the arrangement of
the money department; and so well did he manage
the business, that, in a very short space of time, he
had the satisfaction of receiving a hundred thousand
francs, in exchange for the bills which he held.</p>

<p>Chauvignac, ever watchful for his own interest,
immediately claimed his portion of the booty.
Half the sum (as had been agreed on) was handed
over to him, for having arranged the scheme and
prepared the victim. The remaining fifty thousand
francs were left in the hands of Chaffard, to be
divided between the three philosophers.</p>

<p>But the cunning rascal finding himself in possession
of funds sufficient to give him a year's enjoyment
and luxury, and living, as he did, in fear from
day to day of being arrested for his numerous
misdeeds, instead of going to Paris, directed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
steps to Brussels, to play in his turn (but in good
earnest) the <i>rôle</i> of a French capitalist.</p>

<p>In a moment of weakness, Chaffard had confided
his project to Chauvignac, who immediately wrote,
and told the two other philosophers of it.</p>

<p>Raymond, who was a philosopher in the true
acceptation of the word, received the news with
great coolness; he had learned to his cost that one
must never depend on the honour of a rogue.</p>

<p>This fresh <i>escapade</i> of Chaffard did not surprise
him; he had rather expected it.</p>

<p>With Andréas it was otherwise: furious at seeing
himself the puppet of a man whom he regarded as his
inferior, if not in bodily strength, at least in intelligence
and sagacity, he swore that he would overtake
the thief, and make him disgorge his ill-gotten gains.</p>

<p>Full of artifices and schemes, he started for
Belgium; but, by way of precaution, he took
with him, as a fellow-traveller and companion, a
celebrated pugilist&mdash;a sort of herculean bull-dog,
whom he intended to let loose at his antagonist, if
occasion required.</p>

<p>Once separated from the man, whom he had
every reason to regard as his bad angel, Raymond
felt no longer sufficient strength to follow the dangerous
profession, into which he had been so fatally
enticed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
The constant dangers by which he was surrounded,
a last spark of conscience, and a return of
better feelings, made him determine to quit for ever
the discreditable career which he was following.</p>

<p>Possessed of twenty thousand francs, he had
sufficient funds to keep him for awhile, and give
him time to find some employment, which would
enable him to live honourably. But after some
months, led on by his old love of gambling in general
and roulette in particular, he visited the various
spas and watering-places, where those engines of
ruin, gambling tables, are to be found, and where
he undertook his famous crusade against the banks
and their "croupiers."</p>

<p>We know the result of the calculations and computations
of Voisin Raymond,&mdash;the inevitable fate
of all gamesters who count on benefiting by the
favours of fortune.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It took Raymond some days to narrate to me
the above story, as, when the clock struck the hour
for beginning to play, he immediately quitted me,
and thought of nothing but his hypothetical combinations.</p>

<p>He was trying a new system, about which,
by-the-bye, he would never tell me a word, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
I had little doubt that it would prove as fallacious
as the former one, and leave him nothing but his
own bright dreams as his reward.</p>

<p>When I quitted Baden, he was penniless, and I
had to add to the loan I had already made him.</p>

<p>Since his conversion, I had had good proof, that
he preferred suffering the most severe privations,
rather than have recourse to his skill in sharping;
and this it was which made me advance him a larger
sum.</p>

<p>When we parted, I left Raymond overjoyed
with the hopes of being able to repay me all he
owed, in a very short space of time, and even of
being able to break the bank with the money I
had lent him.</p>

<p>These golden visions, alas! were never destined
to be realised. Soon afterwards, I went to Paris
to resume my "séances," and whilst there, I received
a letter from Raymond, making a last appeal
to my generosity, to enable him to live until he got
a situation he was trying for.</p>

<p>Wishing to prevent a recurrence of similar
appeals, I did not answer his letter, but wrote to
one of my friends at Strasbourg, to send the
wretched man fifty francs, without telling him the
name of his benefactor.</p>

<p>A whole year passed without my hearing any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
more of Raymond. I thought it very probable he
had died of want, when one day, on returning home
in a cab, I could not drive up to my own door, as
an elegant brougham, which had just driven up,
was standing opposite to it.</p>

<p>I therefore got out, and what was my astonishment,
at recognising in my visitor, Voisin Raymond,
extremely well dressed, and sporting all his beard,
as in the former happy roulette days, except that
it was not quite so long.</p>

<p>I almost hesitated to address him, so great was
my surprise; I thought I must be the victim of
an illusion.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Raymond (making use of precisely
the same words he did at our first meeting
at Baden), "how a beard changes a man! especially
when that man is transformed into a demi-millionnaire!"</p>

<p>"Come in quickly," said I to Raymond, "I am
curious to know, to what lucky chance you owe
your present prosperity."</p>

<p>My visitor followed me without uttering a word,
and even after our entrance into the drawing-room,
still remained silent.</p>

<p>I was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"How is it, my friend, that your great good luck
has never been mentioned in the newspapers? You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
know, that when the bank loses, they make a point of
giving the fact publicity through the press, in hopes
of alluring fresh players?"</p>

<p>Still no reply from Raymond; but, after a protracted
silence of several moments, he said:</p>

<p>"I am doing my best to find some means of
prolonging your error; not finding any, I decide to
tell you the truth.</p>

<p>"You doubtless remember, that when I commenced
the history of my life, out of respect for
one of the members of my family, I concealed my
name. It was out of regard to my brother, who
held a high appointment in the magistracy.</p>

<p>"This brother, who, thank God! knew nothing of
my doings, except that I had run through my fortune,
died three months since, without leaving a
will. I am his sole heir, and have come into twenty-five
thousand francs a year.</p>

<p>"This is how I have managed to become a rich
man.</p>

<p>"I have entirely renounced gambling," continued
Raymond. "I am rich enough for all I require, and
have no ambition to become more wealthy.</p>

<p>"I could now, however," added he, with an air
of triumph, "break every one of the banks, if I
liked; and what a glorious vengeance I could take
for all my former ill-luck! Fortunately, my heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
is too full of happiness to leave any room for
vengeance."</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Raymond took up his abode in the Marais, where
he lived respected. I lost sight of him, when I went
to reside in the country; but three years afterwards,
I had occasion to come to Paris, and learned that my
friend had died, and left all his fortune to various
charitable institutions in the capital.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FALSE CUT.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">saut de coupe</i>&mdash;The passe-coupe&mdash;The cut above&mdash;The large card&mdash;The
bridge&mdash;The bent card.</p></blockquote>

<p>The art of making a false cut, is the most important
artifice employed by sharpers: and the
Greek always exerts his best energies to accomplish
this feat.</p>

<p>In order to show what a false cut is, I must
recall to the mind of my reader, the use and end of
the regular cut.</p>

<p>In all games of cards, it is the custom for the
dealer, when he has done shuffling, to present the
pack of cards to his adversary to cut: it is a sort of
guarantee of good faith, which is also performed
even amongst perfectly honest players.</p>

<p>The following is the way in which it is generally
<span class="locked">done:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The cards are placed by the dealer near his
adversary.</p>

<div id="ip_158" class="figcenter" style="width: 514px;"><img src="images/i_b_158.jpg" width="514" height="123" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
The adversary cuts, that is to say, he takes away
a portion of the pack of cards, and places them
beside the dealer, thus making two packets, No. 1
and No. 2.</p>

<div id="ip_159" class="figcenter" style="width: 519px;"><img src="images/i_b_159.jpg" width="519" height="129" alt="" /></div>

<p>The dealer raises the packet No. 2 and places it
on No. 1.</p>

<div id="ip_159b" class="figcenter" style="width: 518px;"><img src="images/i_b_159b.jpg" width="518" height="132" alt="" /></div>

<p>Thus the two packets are formed into one, and
the natural or artificial arrangement of the cards is
disordered.</p>

<p>It is of great importance to the Greek to prevent
this, as it would defeat his plans, and prevent him
availing himself of the arrangements he has made
against his adversary. It is necessary, then, for his
success, that the two packets, whilst in his hands,
should regain their first position. For this purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
he employs different methods, the principal
of which <span class="locked">are:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. The saut de coupe.</li>
<li>2. The cut beneath.</li>
<li>3. The cut above.</li>
<li>4. The bridge.</li>
<li>5. The large card.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="vspace">PART I.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE "SAUT DE COUPE."</span></h3>

<p>The reader who is uninitiated in the mysteries
of sleight of hand, will probably think it incredible,
not to say impossible, that a Greek can thus
transpose invisibly the arrangement of two packs
of cards, before the very eyes of his adversaries.
Nothing, however, is more true.</p>

<p>The treatises on sleight of hand give the
method of executing this trick. As this work,
however, has not for its object the same sort of
instruction, I shall content myself with unveiling
here, the preparations and arrangements necessary
for the performance of the trick.</p>

<p>When the Greek, takes up the packet of
cards No. 2, to place them on No. 1, as before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
mentioned, instead of placing them equally one
upon the top of the other [which would prevent his
being able to distinguish them], he places No. 2 a
little further back than No. 1, so that the latter
advances about a quarter of an inch beyond, as
exemplified below, in figure 4.</p>

<div id="ip_161" class="figcenter" style="width: 159px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 4.</div><img src="images/i_b_161.jpg" width="159" height="40" alt="" /></div>

<p>By means of this projection of the cards, the
Greek, as soon as he gets the pack between his
hands, slips the little finger of his left hand between
the two packets Nos. 1 and 2, and holds himself in
readiness "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sauter la coupe</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_I" id="FNanchor_I" href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">I</a> when the opportunity
serves.</p>

<p>Clever swindlers have yet another, and more
adroit, manner of keeping the two packets separate.</p>

<p>They will, with the right hand, take up packet
No. 2 as if to place it on the other; but, instead of
so doing, they manage to keep the two sufficiently
apart, to enable them to slip the little finger of
the left hand between, in the same way as before
mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<div id="ip_162" class="figcenter" style="width: 237px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 5.</div><img src="images/i_b_162.jpg" width="237" height="190" alt="" /></div>

<p>I have just said, that a Greek always waits his
opportunity to execute the sliding cut.</p>

<p>It is only the new hands who are in a hurry.
The experienced sharper always bides his time, and,
whilst relating some amusing anecdote, accompanied
by a variety of gestures and gesticulations
with his other hand, completely draws off the
attention of the company, and prevents their
watching his performances.</p>

<p>For example, "What are the stakes?" he will
ask, with an air of unconsciousness, stretching out
his hand towards them; and with the same gesture
towards the score, he will ascertain the number of
points, as if he was not thinking what he was about.</p>

<p>But let the "sliding-cut" be performed ever so
well, it is very difficult to practise it where the play
is high. In such company, every dealer ought to
be sober in his movements; for, the least gesture
which deviates from the regular rules, in sorting,
shuffling, or dealing the cards, is certain to awaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
suspicion. But a Greek is, notwithstanding,
seldom at fault; if he fail with one trickery, he has
another at hand, his <i>répertoire</i> being as varied as it
is numerous.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART II.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE PASSE-COUPE, OR CUT BENEATH.</span></h3>

<p>All sharpers are cunning, clever, and tricky, but
they do not all possess the same facility for tricks of
sleight of hand. Many of them not being able to
accomplish the sliding cut, so as not to be seen, are
obliged to have recourse to other tricks less difficult.
Of this number is the "passe-coupe."</p>

<p>This trick is of the same use as the preceding
one, and, if well executed, stands as little chance of
being discovered.</p>

<p>In order to explain this trick, it is necessary for
me to revert to that paragraph where the cards
have been divided into two packs by cutting.</p>

<div id="ip_163" class="figcenter" style="width: 486px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 6.</div><img src="images/i_b_163.jpg" width="486" height="126" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
The Greek, in taking up the two packets of
cards, instead of putting No. 2 on No. 1, slides it in
underneath, as in figure 7.</p>

<div id="ip_164" class="figcenter" style="width: 253px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 7.</div><img src="images/i_b_164.jpg" width="253" height="216" alt="" /></div>

<p>When he has raised packet No. 2, he places it
between the first and second fingers, and whilst
raising packet No. 1, artfully manages to slide it
underneath.</p>

<p>To facilitate this manœuvre, the rogue takes care
to bend the cards whilst he shuffles them.</p>

<p>Some Greeks, instead of placing the packet
No. 2 between the two first fingers, merely take
the cards into their hands, and slide them beneath
one another, as above described. But in this latter
case the transposition is easily discovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART III.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE ENJAMBAGE, OR CUT ABOVE.</span></h3>

<p>The "cut above" is a very simple and clever
trick, and it is astonishing, when one knows it, to
think how easily people are deceived, and that it
should not be discovered. However, I candidly
confess, the first time I saw it done, I was taken in,
as others are.</p>

<p>In this trick, the Greek, instead of placing
packet No. 2 on packet No. 1, passes the former
over without stopping into the left hand, which
he holds a little in advance, and places packet
No. 1 on the top.</p>

<p>This trick, as well as the preceding one, is more
especially practised in public-houses and places of
low resort.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART IV.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE CARTE LARGE, OR LARGE CARD.</span></h3>

<p>The heading of this division sufficiently indicates
the nature of the trick I am about to
describe.</p>

<p>It is to have one card larger than all the rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
When introduced into a pack this card, by its projection,
almost forces the pack to divide, wherever
the person who places it wishes.</p>

<p>If the Greek has previously arranged the cards
as he wishes them to be, their being cut, in no way
disarranges his plans, as the card alluded to remains
where it was placed at the commencement of the
deal.</p>

<p>The large card is also used by the swindler as a
sort of mark, to alter the cut to wherever he thinks
it would be most beneficial to him.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART V.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE PONT, OR BRIDGE.</span></h3>

<p>The bridge is one of the oldest tricks in use
amongst sharpers, and it is almost impossible to be
on one's guard against its use, when well done.</p>

<p>As in the preceding examples, it is used to make
a false cut, and thus to retain the cards as they have
been arranged by the sharper to enable him to
win.</p>

<p>The pack of cards must be held in the right hand,
and bent, by pressing them against the first finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
of the left. The upper part of the pack must then
be bent in an opposite direction, so as to form an
arch, as in figure 8.</p>

<div id="ip_167" class="figcenter" style="width: 69px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 8.</div><img src="images/i_b_167.jpg" width="69" height="124" alt="" /></div>

<p>This being accomplished, the upper portion of the
pack is laid on the top of the other, as if to mix the
cards.</p>

<p>The two bent cards are thus brought in contact,
and it is the gap produced by these two arcs,
which forces the cut to be made oftener at that spot
than at any other, as represented in figure 9.</p>

<div id="ip_167b" class="figcenter" style="width: 139px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 9.</div><img src="images/i_b_167b.jpg" width="139" height="67" alt="" /></div>

<p>The smallest space between any two cards is
sufficient for this purpose. The "carte tuilée,"
or card bent lengthways, is also used for this
purpose.</p>

<p>The two portions of the pack, being bent lengthways,
and laid face to face, are sure to make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
cut at that particular spot, by causing a division
in the pack; but this trick is not so good as
the last-mentioned, and is, consequently, seldom
employed.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_IIA" id="CHAPTER_IIA">CHAPTER II.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">TO CHANGE A CARD.</span></h2>

<p>"<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Filer la carte</i>" is to change one card for
another.</p>

<p>In the hands of an adroit sharper, this change
is performed so instantaneously, that it is almost
impossible for the quickest eye to detect it.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that, in dealing the cards, the
Greek discovers, by means which I will hereafter
explain, that the card he is going to give to his
adversary would be advantageous to himself, he
hides, or slips away, the card which ought to have
been dealt to his adversary, and gives him, instead,
the one which follows.</p>

<p>I will just explain how this manœuvre is
managed.</p>

<p>When the Greek intends to perform this trick,
he takes care, whilst dealing, to push two cards a
little in advance of the rest of the pack, as shown
in Nos. 1 and 2 in figure 10.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<div id="ip_170" class="figcenter" style="width: 422px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 10.</div><img src="images/i_b_170.jpg" width="422" height="254" alt="" /></div>

<p>In a regular deal, No. 1 would be given before
No. 2; but if the Greek thinks it to his interest
to retain it, he substitutes the second for the first.
Thus, by holding the two cards together, between
his thumb and forefinger, he pushes them contrary
ways, that is to say, he pushes No. 2 forward, and
No. 1 backward, as represented in the figure below.</p>

<div id="ip_170b" class="figcenter" style="width: 415px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 11.</div><img src="images/i_b_170b.jpg" width="415" height="245" alt="" /></div>

<p>He then passes over the first card with his right
hand, and gives the second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
This feat, which I have been obliged to explain
thus lengthily, to make it clearly understood, ought
to be done instantaneously, and with the rapidity
of lightning.</p>

<p>Those who are expert, whilst advancing the right
hand to give a card, at the same time draw back
the left. This manœuvre completely deceives the
eye, and may be practised as often as is necessary
for the card in reserve to come into the hand of
the Greek.</p>

<p>To give an idea how completely a person may
be deceived by this trick, I will just relate what
once happened to myself.</p>

<p>A certain Greek (of whom I have already
spoken in my Memoirs) was anxious to show me
this trick, and by way of illustrating his theory,
selected the King of Spades, and placed it on the
top of the pack. He then dealt the cards one after
the other, and by thirty-one successive "filages,"
he so managed, that the King of Spades was the
last card of the pack.</p>

<p>I acknowledge, and indeed I do so still, that so
adroit was he, that though I knew the trick myself,
I could not detect him.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_IIIA" id="CHAPTER_IIIA">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE ABSTRACTED CARD.</span></h2>

<p>When one has not been initiated into the mysteries
of sleight-of-hand, it is difficult to believe
that a sharper can abstract several cards, and put
them back again, under the very eyes of his antagonist,
without being detected. Such, however, is
the fact.</p>

<p>The art of abstracting cards is one of the most
useful tricks in sleight-of-hand, and it requires
great skill and adroitness to perform the feat
cleverly.</p>

<p>In order to do this trick, the Greek keeps
the cards he wishes to abstract, placed diagonally
in his left hand, at the top of the others, and a
little advanced towards his right hand; as in
figure 12.</p>

<div id="ip_172" class="figcenter" style="width: 303px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 12.</div><img src="images/i_b_172.jpg" width="303" height="175" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
He takes possession of the cards with his right
hand, and holds them tightly between the top
joints of the four fingers, and the first joint of the
thumb, or the <i>thenar</i>, as it is termed in medical
parlance.</p>

<p>The cards are consequently slightly bent, as in
figure 13.</p>

<div id="ip_173" class="figcenter" style="width: 276px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 13.</div><img src="images/i_b_173.jpg" width="276" height="118" alt="" /></div>

<p>There is yet another manner of abstracting
cards; but it is less practised by sharpers, than by
conjurors, who often show off the trick in various
ways, where it would be impossible for a sharper
to make use of it.</p>

<p>It simply consists in holding the cards lightly,
between the thumb and little finger of the hand
which takes up the cards; a very slight pressure
will do, and in this manner the cards do not require
to be bent.</p>

<div id="ip_173b" class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 14.</div><img src="images/i_b_173b.jpg" width="280" height="110" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
My readers will doubtless be surprised to hear,
that as many as six cards can be thus hidden in
the hand, at one time, without being seen; and it
will astonish them even more, when I tell them,
that a clever sharper will, with the same hand
where the cards are concealed, cut and go on with
the game, gesticulating in the most natural way,
without any difficulty.</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_IVA" id="CHAPTER_IVA">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE CARD REPLACED.</span></h2>

<p>Once in possession of the cards which he has
abstracted, the Greek, whether the game he is
playing be Lansquenet, Baccarat, or Vingt-et-un,
replaces them in the pack in such a way, that they
will be sure when dealt to return to him.</p>

<p>This trick is the easiest to execute that I have
yet described.</p>

<p>The Greek waits, until it is his turn to gather
up, either the whole, or a portion of, the pack;
then, whilst drawing them towards him, he quietly
places the cards he had in reserve on the top, taking
care to hide the action, by spreading out his hand
over them.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_VA" id="CHAPTER_VA">CHAPTER V.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE CARTE A L'ŒIL, OR GLANCE.</span></h2>

<p>In playing, it is sometimes necessary for the
Greek to obtain a sight of some particular card
in the pack.</p>

<p>In order to do this, he resorts to the following
<span class="locked">manœuvre:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>One of his little fingers is slipped into the pack,
where the card he wishes to see, lies; quick as
lightning he glances his eye across it, and with
such rapidity is the action performed, that those
playing with him cannot see it, particularly as the
backs of the cards are turned towards them, and he
is gesticulating with his other hand, to draw off
their attention.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SUBSTITUTION DES JEUX, OR PACK OF CARDS CHANGED.</span></h2>

<blockquote class="sub">

<p class="center">The substituted pack&mdash;The box in the sleeve.</p></blockquote>

<p>The way this is done depends much on the class
of Greek performing the trick.</p>

<p>The high-bred sharper, for instance, very seldom
makes use of it; he has other far more subtle
methods, unknown to his brother rogue of low
life.</p>

<p>The following tricks, however, may be considered
as common to Greeks of every <span class="locked">shade:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A sharper has always under his coat, at the
back of his trowsers, one or more little pockets,
termed <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">finettes</i>, in which are carried the packs of
cards he intends substituting for those of the house
where he plays. These cards are so placed, that
they can be drawn out with great facility, as may
be perceived by the sketch on the next page.</p>

<p>Before the play begins, the Greek wanders
about the room, in the neighbourhood of the card-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>tables,
with his right hand placed, as shown, on
his hip, and seizes a favourable opportunity, when
he thinks no one is observing him, to substitute
his own pack for those on the table, slipping the
latter into a deep pocket called a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">profonde</i>, which
he has under the flap of his coat.</p>

<div id="ip_178" class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 15.</div><img src="images/i_b_178.jpg" width="443" height="521" alt="" /></div>

<p>Others, more bold in their manœuvres, do not
fear to execute this trick before the very eyes of
their adversaries.</p>

<p>To do this with ease, pockets are made in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
waistcoat, and are called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">costières</i>, or side <span class="locked">pockets,<a name="FNanchor_J" id="FNanchor_J" href="#Footnote_J" class="fnanchor">J</a></span>
because they are made at the left side, a little
above the region of the heart. They are entirely
hidden by the coat.</p>

<p>1st. In seating himself at the table, the Greek
artfully draws out of one of his pockets the prepared
cards, and holds them in readiness in his
right hand, as I have before described in the
chapter on the "Abstraction of Cards."</p>

<p>2nd. He then, with his left hand, takes up
the pack which is on the table, as if to withdraw
it from its envelope, and places his own
pack on the top, carefully hiding both packs with
his right hand.</p>

<p>3rd. He manages, in cutting, to put the false
pack at the top, and removes the other, in the
manner already related in the chapter on "Abstraction."</p>

<p>4th. Finally, he disposes of the original pack in
his large pocket, or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">profonde</i>.</p>

<p>To accomplish this feat with greater facility, he
pretends to draw his chair nearer to the table,
which brings his hand in juxtaposition with his
pocket.</p>

<p>All the operations above described, may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
regarded as one, and are performed with infinite
address and promptitude, whilst the Greek is entertaining
his adversary with some animated and
amusing discourse.</p>

<p>It is needless to say, that the two envelopes of
the cards are identical, the Greek of course having
seen to that beforehand.</p>

<p>When sharpers find, that they have to be continually
changing the packs of cards, and dread
detection, should they try the trick too often, they
arrange with one of their associates, whom they
bribe, by offering him half the profits, to go and
take the place of a servant, in those houses or
clubs where they intend to cheat.</p>

<p>With such an arrangement, the two Greeks
quietly pocket considerable sums. Others, less
wary, take no accomplice, but change the cards
themselves.</p>

<p>The Greek first finds out the name and address
of the tradesman who furnishes the playing
cards to the house or club, which he is in the
habit of frequenting. He then goes to the shop,
and makes a few trifling purchases, just to pave
his way. He does this more than once, and
returns again and again.</p>

<p>At length, one fine day, he calls at the shop to
select, for a friend (he says), a dozen, or half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
dozen, packs of cards, according as the shop is a
large or a small one.</p>

<p>The next morning, pretending that the cards are
not of the colour required, he takes them back again.</p>

<p>The packets being unopened, the shopkeeper has
no hesitation in receiving and changing them for
others.</p>

<p>But the Greek has passed the night, in opening
and re-sealing the packets by a peculiar process
known to sharpers.</p>

<p>The cards have been marked by him, before
returning them to the shopkeeper, who has them
now in his shop. The cheat is accomplished, and
the Greek is biding his time.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART I.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE BOX IN THE SLEEVE.</span></h3>

<p>There is yet another way of changing the pack,
under the very eyes of your adversary. It consists
in having a tin box fastened to your arm, under
the sleeve of your coat, and which is not perceptible.</p>

<p>In this box, the Greek carries the cards he
has marked for his own purposes.</p>

<p>When it is his turn to cut, he stretches out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
hand across the table towards the pack, so as to
hide it entirely; then, resting his arm lightly on
the tablecloth, he presses a spring which opens
the box, out of which falls the marked pack,&mdash;at
the same time that there comes out another spring,
which seizes the cards on the table, and draws them
into the box.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter, I ought to
mention that, though all these various tricks are
each clever in their way, they cannot be employed
indiscriminately.</p>

<p>The operations in question must depend on
circumstances, and the manner of employing them
should vary, according to whether they be performed
in a smoking-tavern, a gambling-house, a
drawing-room, or a club.</p>

<p>The Greek knows well what will suit each party
with whom he plays, and rarely ventures on the
trick without he is sure of succeeding.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FALSE SHUFFLE.</span></h2>

<blockquote class="sub">

<p class="center">False shuffles: The arranged shuffle&mdash;The partial shuffle&mdash;The fan&mdash;The
dove-tail.</p></blockquote>

<p>It may be said that a false shuffle is not cheating,
since the cards are but retained in their
original order. Such acts, however, are not far
removed from cheating, and the persons who are
guilty of them may be compared to the receivers
of stolen goods, who, though not the actual robbers,
are judged to be so by the law.</p>

<p>When the pack of cards has been arranged by
the sharper, whether he prepares them beforehand,
or only in the presence of his adversary, he must
be very careful not to disturb them.</p>

<p>To avoid this, he has recourse to various methods
of evading a proper shuffle.</p>

<p>Of these there are four kinds, which vary according
to the circumstances required.</p>

<p>They are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The arranged shuffle.</li>
<li>The partial shuffle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></li>
<li>The fan.</li>
<li>The dove-tail.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="vspace">PART I.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE ARRANGED SHUFFLE.</span></h3>

<p>The arranged shuffle consists in pretending to
shuffle, whilst all the time you are arranging the
cards, in the order you require them for cheating.
Let us suppose, for example, that a Greek, in
playing Écarté, places in the pack four cards of the
same suit, three of which are trumps, and the
fourth is the turn-up card; this he manages to do
by arranging the shuffle in the following manner.
He divides the pack of cards into two parts, holding
one in each hand, as it is usual to do in shuffling
in the ordinary way. In mixing the two
packs, he knows how to slip in successively, above
the four cards, seven others, which will complete
the series necessary for the deal.</p>

<p>He then hands them to be cut, makes a false
cut, and when he has dealt out the eleven cards,
the four remaining are three trumps and the turn-up
card.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
The arrangement of the game of Piquet, mentioned
in another chapter, is a further instance of
this trick.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART II.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE PARTIAL SHUFFLE.</span></h3>

<p>The partial shuffle is employed for those games,
where only a portion of the cards is distributed at
a time, such as Écarté. In this instance, we will
suppose the Greek to have arranged eleven cards,
so as to enable him to win the game, and it is
of consequence that these cards should not be
disarranged.</p>

<p>He therefore puts these eleven cards at the
bottom of the pack, and, at the same time, carefully
keeps his little finger between the upper and lower
packet, which he avoids mixing, until after dealing
the twenty-first card. This done, he performs the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">saut de coupe</i> a second time, to bring the arranged
packet again on the top of the pack, unless, by
making the bridge, he gains the same end by
forcing his adversary's cut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART III.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE FAN.</span></h3>

<p>The following trick is termed the Fan, because
the Greek, to do the false shuffle, spreads the
cards out in the shape of a fan. He then divides
the pack into two parts, holding, as before, one in
each hand; then, by a certain manipulation with
the fingers of his right hand, he passes the cards
under those in the left, which, to the spectator,
gives the effect of mixing the cards; but this is far
from being the case. The cards retain the position
they would have done if the pack had been cut, as
the upper packet has passed beneath the lower one.
The operation, consequently, requires to be gone
through a second time, to bring the cards into their
original position. This shuffle may remain in the
above condition as long as the Greek finds it
convenient.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART IV.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE DOVE-TAIL.</span></h3>

<p>The ways of doing the false shuffle are numerous,
each Greek having some special method of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
own. All of them are more or less derived from
the principles I have just described.</p>

<p>It would take too long, as well as be useless, to
enter into the details of these proceedings, as they
are nearly all the same.</p>

<p>The false shuffle, with which I am about to close
this chapter, is a peculiar one, and is very often
used by sharpers.</p>

<p>To prevent any suspicions which might be raised
by the use of the preceding shuffle, the Greek
sometimes employs the Dove-tail, which consists in
separating the cards into two packs, and then
shuffling them one with the other; but, instead of
finishing the shuffle by equalising the pack, the
Greek manages to leave them at an angle as they
are represented in figure 16 below.</p>

<div id="ip_187" class="figcenter" style="width: 180px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 16.</div><img src="images/i_b_187.jpg" width="180" height="152" alt="" /></div>

<p>Then begins an operation which is hidden by his
right hand.</p>

<p>The Greek, after having passed packet No. 1
across packet No. 2, twists round the lower portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
in a semicircle towards the right, which completely
separates it from the other, and allows him to replace
it beneath packet No. 1, as it originally was.</p>

<p class="hangcenter">Cartes biseautées&mdash;Tinted cards&mdash;Sticky or slippery cards&mdash;Slanting
cards&mdash;Pricked cards&mdash;Cards with indented edges&mdash;Wavy cards&mdash;Chequered
cards&mdash;Marked cards.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="vspace">PART I.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE CARTES BISEAUTÉES.</span></h3>

<p>The Biseautée Card was one of the principal
methods of cheating in the last century. The trick,
at that period, was only known to the adepts of
the higher ranks, and with it they succeeded in
victimising numbers of people.</p>

<p>It is now chiefly made use of in public-houses,
for it is so plain and palpable an artifice, that it
could not fail to be discovered by more intelligent
people than those who frequent these resorts.</p>

<p>The real signification of "biseautées" cards is,
that they are larger at one end than at the other,
as in figure 17.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
To do this, the Greek, with a pair of sharp
scissors, cuts both sides of every card, beginning at
the twentieth part of an inch, and going off to
nothing.</p>

<div id="ip_190" class="figcenter" style="width: 76px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 17.</div><img src="images/i_b_190.jpg" width="76" height="120" alt="" /></div>

<p>All the cards being equally clipped at one end,
if they are placed contrariwise, it is evident the
edges will protrude the smallest bit possible beyond
the other cards, and can be easily discovered by
the sharper, however carefully they may have been
shuffled by the opposite party.</p>

<p>What answers with one card, will do so
equally with all. Thus, we will suppose the
Greek has put all the court cards one way, and
the common cards the other, he can, by feeling
the cards in cutting, cut a court card or not, as
he pleases.</p>

<p>This I merely give as one example, for slanting
cards can be used in various other ways.</p>

<p>Some Greeks make use of cards cut on both
sides, in two opposite ways: it is the same thing
under another form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
For instance, the cards represented below are cut
so that the edge of some are convex, as in figure 18,
and others concave, as in figure 19.</p>

<div id="ip_191" class="figcenter" style="width: 187px;"><div class="caption">Figs. 18 and 19.</div><img src="images/i_b_191.jpg" width="187" height="124" alt="" /></div>

<p>The result, with these cards, is the same as with
the preceding, only that the latter afford a greater
scope for cheating.</p>

<p>The more expert a sharper is, the less is it necessary
to cut the edges of the cards; indeed, I have
seen some so slightly cut, that you were obliged to
examine them with the greatest minuteness to find
it out.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART II.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE TINTED, OR STAINED CARD.</span></h3>

<p>When white cards are not of first-rate quality,
many of them are slightly tinted or stained; that
is to say, the purity of the white varies. This
imperfection is caused by the bad quality of the
card-board of which they are manufactured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
From these slight shades, the Greek can, after
seeing them for a few moments, recognise many of
the cards.</p>

<p>If there are no blemishes or stains on them,
the Greek contrives to give them various tints,
which he alone can perceive. To this end, he rubs
very lightly over, with a cloth dipped in blacklead,
such of the cards as he wishes to know again.</p>

<p>The person with whom the Greek is playing,
even if he were warned of this trick, could scarcely
observe the marks. It requires the lynx eyes of the
sharper to distinguish the imperceptible shades.</p>

<p>We ought also to mention that the Greeks
have each their particular <i>forte</i>. One who has an
excellent eyesight, and sensitive touch, will make
use of the marked cards; another, for other reasons,
will have recourse to sleight of hand.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART III.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE ADHERENT, OR SLIDING CARDS.</span></h3>

<p>By the foregoing it will be observed, that a
Greek is always ready to profit by the slightest
differences in the cards; but what my readers will
scarcely find credible is, that even a pack of new
cards, when first taken out of its envelope, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
furnish him with the means and signs of recognising
the court from the plain cards. This cheat is most
practicable, when the cards have not been kept in a
perfectly dry place.</p>

<p>The Greek, in dealing, presses his left thumb
on the cards, as if to disengage the upper ones, and
push them towards his right hand. When the cards
are damp, the plain ones slide more easily than the
court cards, the reason for which, is to be thus
accounted <span class="locked">for:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>That in manufacturing the court cards, and in
order to give a brightness to their colours, a preparation
of gum is used, which is easily affected
by the damp, and becomes slightly sticky; this is
why they do not slip with such facility as the others.</p>

<p>The higher class of sharpers are much in the
habit of using this trick, which they perform with
a sensitiveness of touch of astounding delicacy.</p>

<p>The lower order of Greek is obliged to prepare
the pack beforehand, and rubs the court cards
lightly over with soap, and the others he paints with
an extremely pure resin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART IV.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE "HORS D'ÉQUERRE," OR SLANTING CARDS.</span></h3>

<p>I was once requested by a magistrate, to examine
some packs of cards which had been seized
in a gambling-house, and many of which had
been used for the game of Vingt-et-un. I acceded
to his request, and it was only owing to my knowledge
of mechanism, that I was enabled to discover
the trick, by means of which the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">banquier</i> of the
gambling-table could distinguish, whilst dealing,
whether the card he took from the top of the
pack was higher or lower than a ten.</p>

<p>All the court cards and aces were cut on the
slant at the top, so as to prevent them being quite
straight, as in figure 20, but much less so in reality
than is here represented.</p>

<div id="ip_194" class="figcenter" style="width: 75px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 20.</div><img src="images/i_b_194.jpg" width="75" height="125" alt="" /></div>

<p>To discover this very slight alteration it required
a most practised eye; but slight as it was, it was
sufficient for the sharper; and, according to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
indications, he either took the upper card, if it were
to his advantage, or dealt to himself the lower one
by the <span class="locked">"filage."<a name="FNanchor_K" id="FNanchor_K" href="#Footnote_K" class="fnanchor">K</a></span> In this manner he could also,
at the end of the deal, retain or give himself the
card he required.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART V.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE "POINTÉES," OR PRICKED CARDS.</span></h3>

<p>These marks are made by the Greek to distinguish
all the high cards.</p>

<p>With the point of a pin, a little blunted, he pricks
the card in the corner at the side of the picture,
so as to produce a minute elevation on the upper
surface.</p>

<p>Some Greeks improve on this trick, by pricking
between the two card-boards, and afterwards
pasting them together again. In this way, nothing is
to be seen on the upper part of the card but a small
roughness, which, should it ever be remarked, would
pass for a defect in the card-board.</p>

<p>Others, who are still more adroit, instead of
making any mark above, do it from beneath, and in
this manner the mark is completely hidden by the
painting, and can only be discovered by the touch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART VI.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE CARDS "MORFILÉES," OR WITH INDENTED EDGES.</span></h3>

<p>This trick very much resembles the preceding
one, only that it is done in presence of the dupe.</p>

<p>Each time that a card which will be favourable
to his play, passes through the hands of the
Greek, he makes a small dent with his nail on the
edge of it. This mark is easily felt by the Greek.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, that those amongst the
Greeks who are adepts at this trick, have an extreme
delicacy of touch, which they preserve by
always wearing gloves, when they are not playing
at cards. Some of them even rub the ends of their
fingers with pumice stone, or dip them in certain
acids, which give extreme sensibility to the skin.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART VII.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE "ONDULÉES," OR WAVY CARDS.</span></h3>

<p>The above marks, or waves, are also made whilst
playing.</p>

<p>When the Greek observes any cards, which
will suit him to perform the trick he is about to
play, he makes, at the bottom of the left-hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
corner, a little fold, or arch, inwards. This alteration,
be it ever so slight, produces a kind of lustre
on the card, which the eye of the Greek can
immediately detect.</p>

<p>This trick is generally employed in cheating at
Piquet. The Greek, in this way, marks all the
aces and high cards in any of the suits.</p>

<p>With certain arts of <i>legerdemain</i>, which I have
before alluded to, he can so arrange all, or part, of
his hand, that no play of his adversary, be it ever
so good, could stand against it.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART VIII.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE "TAROTÉES," OR FIGURED OR CHECQUERED CARDS.</span></h3>

<p>It often happens that, in packs of playing-cards,
the backs of which are ornamented with figures
and designs, these ornaments are not placed exactly
in the same spot on each card.</p>

<p>If examined attentively, it will be seen, that the
designs are not always the same distance from the
edge of the card. The manufacturer himself, and
players in general, pay little attention to these
irregularities, but the Greek turns them to account,
and makes them useful in his tricks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
By the time the cards have been dealt two or
three times round, he can distinguish many of them.</p>

<p>Sharpers are themselves often the manufacturers
of their own cards, and can, therefore, arrange and
place their designs where they please.</p>

<p>For instance, let us suppose that the design consists
of a series of lozenges, placed one above the
other. The Greek would so arrange them that,
at the edge of the card, the lozenge should be entire
for the ace. Then, as it approaches the edge, it is
cut in half for the queen, quarterly for the king, and
three-quarters for the knave.</p>

<p>In the same way, on the upper side of the card,
the lozenges, by similar arrangements, would point
out the spades, hearts, clubs, or diamonds, and also
show the principal cards in the game of Piquet.</p>

<p>All this would seem to be the effect of chance,
and no one could assert that there was anything
fraudulent.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART IX.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE MARKED, OR SPOTTED CARDS.</span></h3>

<p>This trick of marking cards, is equal to any of
the most refined abbreviations used in stenography,
as here, by the aid of a single spot, any one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
thirty-two cards in the game of Piquet may be
known.</p>

<p>We will imagine, for example, a design formed
of spots, or some other device, arranged symmetrically,
as these sorts of patterns usually are. For
instance, as in figure 21.</p>

<p>The first large spot, beginning from the top of
the card, on the left hand, will represent a heart;
the second, in descending, a diamond, the third a
club, and the fourth a spade.</p>

<p>Now, if, by the side of any of these, another spot
is added, it will immediately serve to show what
card it is.</p>

<div id="ip_199" class="figcenter" style="width: 254px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 21.</div><img src="images/i_b_199.jpg" width="254" height="418" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
The mark should be placed near one of the
original spots, as shown below in figure 22, which,
when placed at the top, shows it is an ace; going
round to the right of it, the next spot would be a
king, the third spot a queen, the fourth a knave,
and so on to the seven.</p>

<div id="ip_200" class="figcenter" style="width: 56px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 22.</div><img src="images/i_b_200.jpg" width="56" height="52" alt="" /></div>

<p>It must be clearly understood that only one spot
is to be made, as in <a href="#ip_199">figure 21</a>, where that which is
added to the third spot, would (according to the
rules I have laid down), mark the eight of clubs.</p>

<p>After these explanations, I feel convinced, my
reader has already made up his mind, never again
to play with cards on which there are devices.</p>

<p>"If these are the sort of tricks one is subject to,"
exclaims he, "I'll take care that I never play with
anything but plain cards again."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even these can be tampered with,
as I have already shown in speaking of tinted cards;
of which I will now give another proof.</p>

<p>In the year 1849, the judge of the Criminal
Court of the Seine, begged me to examine a hundred
and fifty packs of cards, which were supposed
to have been tampered with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
They were found in the possession of a man,
whose antecedents were far from being as pure,
as the colour of his cards.</p>

<p>The cards were in fact all white, and had hitherto
defied the most minute inspection.</p>

<p>It was impossible for the most practised eye to
discover, that they had been altered or marked in
any way.</p>

<p>They seemed all of the best quality.</p>

<p>I spent nearly a fortnight in examining (not only
with my naked eye, but with a strong magnifying
glass) the card board, the shape, and the almost imperceptible
shades, of each of these one hundred
and fifty packs of cards.</p>

<p>I could detect nothing; and tired out, I was
going to give the same opinion as the experts who
had previously examined them.</p>

<p>"There is certainly nothing wrong with these
cards," exclaimed I, one evening, in a pettish tone,
throwing the pack from me across the table.</p>

<p>All at once, on the shining back of one of the
cards, near one of the corners, I thought I saw a
dull-looking spot, which had before escaped me.
On looking close at it, it disappeared; but strange
to say, as I went far off from it, it re-appeared.</p>

<p>"How glad I am," cried I aloud, enthusiastically.
"Now I see what it is. It's all right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
This then is the mark!" and following the rules,
used by sharpers, I satisfied myself, that on every
card there was the same spot, which, being placed
in various parts, were distinctive signs of the card
and the suit. The following was the way the
thing was done.</p>

<p>We must imagine the cards divided into eight
divisions perpendicularly, and four horizontally, as
in <a href="#ip_203">figure 23</a>. The former will indicate the value
of the card, the latter the suit. The mark is placed
where each of these divisions intersect one another.
The above is the way the cheat is performed, and
practice does the rest.</p>

<p>I must be allowed to decline mentioning the
method, by which these mysterious marks are made
on the cards. My object being, as I have already
stated, more than once, to expose the tricks of
sharpers, but not to show how they are done.
Suffice it to say, that when looked at closely, these
spots are invisible; but when viewed from afar, the
reflection of a strong light makes the card shine,
but leaves the spot dull.</p>

<p>At first sight, it would seem a difficult task to
distinguish one card from another, by an isolated
spot on the back of it. However, if my readers
will attend to what I have told them, and look at
the example given in figure 23, they will see that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
does not belong to the second, nor the fourth perpendicular
division; and by the same rule, they will
observe, that the spot is in the second horizontal
division, and represents, therefore, the queen of
diamonds.</p>

<div id="ip_203" class="figcenter" style="width: 236px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 23.</div><img src="images/i_b_203.jpg" width="236" height="309" alt="" /></div>

<p>From all this, it is evident that a swindler plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
and stakes&mdash;I will not say his honour, but his
liberty, against fortune; and that, by reason of the
importance of the stake, he ought to have devoted
the most serious attention to an art, on which all
his future depends.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CHAPLET, OR ROSARY.</span></h2>

<p>The rosary is a particular arrangement of the
cards, according to certain words in a sentence,
which is learnt by heart. In other words, it is a
sort of mnemonics, or artificial memory, to enable
people to cheat at play. There are several sorts of
"<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chapelets</i>," more or less ingenious. The best are
those which recall to one's mind a feeling, a thought,
or even only an amusing combination.</p>

<p>One of the oldest rosaries consists of two Latin

<p>These thirteen cards are also arranged according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
to their suits, namely&mdash;spades, hearts, clubs,

<li>4. Famulus (knave) of diamonds,</li>
<li>5. Sex (six) of spades,</li>
</ul>

<p class="in0">and so on, by following the words of the rosary and
the suit, to the last card.</p>

<p>I will now give a sentence or rosary, for the thirty-two

<p>In this, as well as in the preceding example, the
cards are classed according to their suits, as above
described; only, at the end of the rosary after the
queen, instead of putting the suit which follows, for
the king which comes after, they arrange so that
the king and queen should be of the same suit.

<li>30. The ace of clubs.</li>
<li>31. The seven of diamonds.</li>
<li>32. The queen of spades.</li>
</ul>

<p>It must be remembered that, when the cards are
thus arranged, however often the pack is cut, the
order of the cards remains the same.</p>

<p>When a Greek has substituted a pack of cards,
arranged <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à chapelet</i> for another, and has made a
false shuffle which does not alter them, he will easily
know what cards his adversary holds, by looking at
his own hand.</p>

<p>For example at Écarté, if he <span class="locked">holds&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>The eight of hearts,</li>
<li>The nine of clubs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></li>
<li>The queen of clubs,</li>
<li>The king of clubs,</li>
<li>The ten of diamonds;</li>
</ul>

<p>He will know that his adversary <span class="locked">has&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>The king of diamonds,</li>
<li>The ten of spades,</li>
<li>The knave of diamonds,</li>
<li>The ace of spades,</li>
<li>The seven of hearts.</li>
</ul>

<p>The turn-up card will be the eight of spades;
and knowing all the other cards which follow after
this, he can demand or refuse them, as he judges
best.</p>

<p>It is, at the games of Vingt-et-un, Baccarat, and
Lansquenet, that this cheating is the most dangerous,
as well as the most easily accomplished. The
packs are changed beforehand, and even though they
may be really properly shuffled, it will be some time
before the order of the cards is completely altered.
Some few cards may be displaced, but the Greek
manages to play on, and to know the card which is
coming, by having seen the one which precedes it.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RING FOR MARKING.</span></h2>

<p>The Greek sometimes carries his trickery even
into the domains of science; of which the instrument
I am about to describe is a proof.</p>

<p>If this jewel had not been invented for the sole
purpose of cheating, one would have been tempted
to admire it.</p>

<p>The ring, shown in <a href="#ip_210">figure 24</a>, is known by the
name of a <i>trépan</i>. It is hollow, and forms a
kind of reservoir, which is filled with very liquid
ink. This liquid would escape by a small opening,
at the point <span class="smcap smaller">A</span>, but that the capillary attraction
retains the ink at its mouth. In short, it is a kind
of pen with a reservoir.</p>

<p>As this point is hidden in the inside of the hand,
the Greek can, at any moment, mark the cards
he pleases, with an almost imperceptible spot, before
the very eyes of his adversary.</p>

<p>These spots can, as I have before explained, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
the manner in which they are placed, mark particular
cards.</p>

<div id="ip_210" class="figcenter" style="width: 140px;"><div class="caption">Fig. 24.</div><img src="images/i_b_210.jpg" width="140" height="179" alt="" /></div>

<p>The Greek also makes use of this instrument
to cheat at dominoes.</p>

<p>For this purpose, the ring is a very massive one,
and the point alluded to is made of steel, and very
sharp.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand, that when the Greek
has the dominoes in his hands, in moving them
about on the table, he can put a mark on them,
so as to know them again.</p>

<p>The point of the ring, fine as it is, is blunted, so
that the marks it makes are so light and shining,
as to awaken no suspicion, and it is only to the
eyes of the sharper, who has made them, that they
are visible.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE REFLECTING SNUFF-BOX.</span></h2>

<p>As I am on the subject of curiosities of art,
here is another, which is also very clever.</p>

<p>It is difficult to believe that a snuff-box can be
made an instrument for cheating.</p>

<p>The Greek, when placing himself at the table
to play, puts down a snuff-box, on the lid of which
is a small medallion of the size of a franc, enclosing
a miniature.</p>

<p>It is the portrait of a lady exquisitely painted.</p>

<p>The eyes of the players naturally turn to this
object, and they sometimes even take it up to
admire, or display it to their friends.</p>

<p>When the game has begun, the Greek takes a
pinch of snuff, which gives him the opportunity of
drawing the box towards him.</p>

<p>But, at the same time, he presses an invisible
spring, which withdraws the portrait, and in its
place out comes a convex glass, which is of the
greatest utility to him; for, when he is dealing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
this mirror being underneath the cards which he
deals to his adversary, he has only to look in it to
see the reflection of the cards he is giving.</p>

<p>During the evening, the Greek makes the medallion
return, and offers a pinch of snuff to his
victims.</p>

<h4>ARRANGEMENT OF THE PACK.</h4>

<p>It is a well-known fact that, by the aid of the
principles which I have herein laid down, a clever
Greek will gain at every game, by giving himself
the cards which are favourable to his interest.</p>

<p>But it must not be believed, that these sharpers
are so unskilful as to cheat always by sleight of
hand. They would very soon be discovered.</p>

<p>These intelligent rogues husband their resources,
and act with prudence. They usually only deal
themselves what is called a "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jeu de règle</i>," or
hand which is sure of making three tricks; and
their adroitness and tact, coupled with this slight
advantage, is sufficient to ensure to them the
favours of fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
In most cases, the Greek only uses his arts
according to the circumstances required. The
more able player he is, the less is it necessary
to call cheating to his aid. If he finds he has
an indifferent player for his opponent, he only
plays the regular game, and reserves his rogueries
for another occasion. But, as it often happens that
the proverb, "a new hand always wins," is verified,
he takes care to be on the defensive, and to use his
weapons if required.</p>

<p>For this reason, it is quite impossible to give
an exact definition of the play of a Greek; but
as I am anxious to enlighten my readers on his
marvellous powers, I will just give one example of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">haute école</i>, or high school, as they say at the
Cirque Olympique (the Astley's of Paris).</p>

<p>It is the greatest <i>coup</i> that it is possible to
make at piquet.</p>

<p>In this trick, which is done in the presence of
his adversary, and without any previous preparation,
the Greek can win the game with a first
hand, by a hundred and sixty-three <span class="locked">points.<a name="FNanchor_L" id="FNanchor_L" href="#Footnote_L" class="fnanchor">L</a></span></p>

<p>In perusing the following details of the different
manipulations, which serve as the basis of all sorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
of cheating at games of cards, I hope my readers
will take this warning, which is the real purpose
of my work:&mdash;that it is dangerous to hazard large
sums of money on chances which can be so easily
turned against them.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART I.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE "COUP DE PIQUET."</span></h3>

<blockquote class="sub">
<p class="center">How to Repique and Capot one's Adversary.</p></blockquote>

<p>The trick I am about to describe, dates from
the last century. It was the invention of a juggler
named Comus, who performed it with his eyes
bandaged.</p>

<p>From this interesting combination, have originated
all the other <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coups de piquet</i>, so often displayed
by jugglers.</p>

<p>I shall here give a description of how it is done,
as it will make what I have mentioned in the preceding
chapter, more easy to understand.</p>

<p>In taking up the pack of cards, the juggler, with
a pretended awkwardness, shuffles the cards in
such a manner, that many of them are turned face
to face. This enables him, under the pretext of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
turning them the right way about, to select and
place at the bottom of the pack a sequence of
eight cards in any suit, a king and three aces.</p>

<p>Once in possession of these twelve cards, he
slightly bends the corners, which leaves a ridge that
he can easily discern. (See <a href="#XIIpartVII">part vii.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_IXA">chapter ix.</a>)</p>

<p>He then hands the cards to his adversary to
shuffle.</p>

<p>Whilst this is being done he has his eyes bandaged
with a handkerchief, which, however, does
not prevent his seeing through the interstices
caused by the projection of his nose.</p>

<p>He then takes back the pack, and whilst pretending
to shuffle, he finds the marked cards, and
places them where he wishes, as will be explained
in the following part.</p>

<p>Some jugglers, instead of bending the cards, with
the greatest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sang froid</i>, pass the twelve cards above
alluded to, underneath the others, and then pretend
to shuffle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART II.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE "COUP DE PIQUET."</span></h3>

<blockquote class="sub">
<p class="center">How the Greek is enabled to Repique and Capot his
Adversary, although he has Shuffled the Cards.</p></blockquote>

<p>As I am addressing those who are supposed to
know piquet, I need enter into no details about
that game.</p>

<p>In playing the first hand, the Greek must secure
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sixième-major</i> (or sequence of six cards from the
ace downwards, which counts sixteen), a quatorze
of aces (the four aces), and a quatorze of kings (the
four kings), as seen by the table <span class="locked">below:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li class="figspace">1. The ace of spades.</li>
<li class="figspace">2. The king of spades.</li>
<li class="figspace">3. The queen of spades.</li>
<li class="figspace">4. The knave of spades.</li>
<li class="figspace">5. The ten of spades.</li>
<li class="figspace">6. The nine of spades.</li>
<li class="figspace">7. The ace of hearts.</li>
<li class="figspace">8. The ace of diamonds.</li>
<li class="figspace">9. The ace of clubs.</li>
<li>10. The king of hearts.</li>
<li>11. The king of diamonds.</li>
<li>12. The king of clubs.</li>
</ul>

<p>His adversary must be the dealer, as it is in
playing the first hand, that the selection of these
twelve cards is managed.</p>

<p>This difficult trick is done in the following
manner. It is customary, before beginning to play,
for each person to cut for the deal.</p>

<p>The Greek, in mixing the cards, with a rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
glance, seeks for an ace, which he passes under the
pack, and putting in practice the principles which
I have pointed out in the first chapter, part 5,
<a href="#ip_167b">figure 9</a>, he makes the bridge.</p>

<p>"Let us see," exclaims he, putting the pack on
the table, "who shall deal?"</p>

<p>He cuts first himself, at the bridge where the
ace (the highest card in cutting at piquet) is placed,
and as it does not often happen that his opponent
cuts another ace&mdash;"You shall deal," says he, "we
will make the game one hundred and fifty points."</p>

<p>The first hand is not of much importance; the
Greek leaves to chance the distribution of the
cards. He well knows that his adversary will not
gain the game in one hand; he, therefore, only
thinks of making himself master of the cards before
mentioned.</p>

<p>Twelve cards are dealt to him by his adversary,
and five others are in reserve for him in the
"<i>talon</i>."</p>

<p>It is most probable that, out of these seventeen
cards, he will find some of the number mentioned
in the preceding list.</p>

<p>He must, at all hazards, prevent those cards
getting into his opponent's hands, and must keep
them near him for the following hand.</p>

<p>Consequently, he discards the weakest cards in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
his hand, and makes a little heap of them on his
right hand, on which he places successively, and
without concealment, all the aces, kings, and spades,
he can get from his adversary.</p>

<p>We will imagine that, by the time the hand is
played, he has only been able to obtain six of the
cards he wants.</p>

<p>To secure the other six, still in the pack, he has
recourse to the following manœuvre.</p>

<p>Whilst playing, he has intentionally left all the
tricks he has gained face upwards; and, as it is
his turn to deal, he does the same thing with those
of his adversary.</p>

<p>Profiting by the moment when the latter is
marking his points, in taking up the pack, the
Greek selects the cards required, and places
them underneath with those which he has already
secured.</p>

<p>If my readers are not "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au fait</i>" at tricks of
cards, they will doubtless find the explanation I
have given, both tedious and difficult of comprehension.
It is really nothing; it resembles those
tricks of sleight of hand, which require long explanations
to make a very short operation understood.</p>

<p>But that is not the question; my sole wish
being to make myself understood, which has perhaps
caused me to be rather prolix.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
The Greek having, in the twinkling of an eye,
put the twelve cards he wanted at the bottom of
the pack, then places them, so that they will all
return to him in the deal, and whilst pretending to
shuffle the cards, he puts alternately on the pack,</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Three cards from the bottom.</li>
<li>2. Three indifferent cards taken from the middle of the pack.</li>
<li>3. Three cards from the bottom.</li>
<li>4. Three indifferent cards.</li>
<li>5. Three cards from the bottom.</li>
<li>6. Three indifferent cards.</li>
</ul>

<p>After which, a false shuffle, a false cut, and a
deal of three at a time.</p>

<p>It will be seen that, out of the twelve cards
which were placed under the pack, nine must have
come back to the Greek in the course of the deal;
the three others come to him in the exchange. He
therefore has in his hand:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. A sixième-major in spades,</li>
<li>2. A quatorze of aces,</li>
<li>3. A quatorze of kings:</li>
</ul>

<p class="in0">with which he gains the game by capoting his
adversary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
In this hand, then, he has made a hundred and
sixty-three points.</p>

<p>This selection of cards, and their arrangement,
is a specimen of what can be done by cheating;
however, a Greek usually will not venture to do
it on so large a scale; but contents himself with a
quatorze of aces or kings, or even a simple quint.
The selection of these cards is simple and easy,
compared with the former trick.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART III.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE "COUP DE PIQUET."</span></h3>

<blockquote class="sub">
<p class="center">Abstraction and Substitution of Cards.</p></blockquote>

<p>In former days, it was the fashion at piquet,
when the deal was finished, to divide the <i>talon</i>
into two unequal packets, and place them one on
the top of the other, in the shape of a cross.
Now, however, these eight cards are left in one
packet.</p>

<p>This new fashion has given rise to a fresh
roguery, which, though a very audacious one, is no
less difficult to discover, where the parties are not
cognisant of it.</p>

<p>Once known, it is quite another thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
This rascality is executed in the following
manner:</p>

<p>The sharper, in dealing, gives himself three cards
too many. He then intentionally places the <i>talon</i>
a little nearer to himself than to his adversary.</p>

<p>The latter, not thinking about it, does not perceive
that his opponent has taken extra cards, being
at that moment as much occupied with taking up
and sorting his cards, as with the discard.</p>

<p>Whilst his adversary is thus occupied, the
sharper hastily takes the three worst cards in his
hand, and conveys them by a method I have
pointed out, and places them on the <i>talon</i>,
pushing it at the same time, as if to place it nearer
to his antagonist. This movement is so natural,
that the artifice is completely concealed.</p>

<p>Thus the Greek is not only relieved of his
three bad cards, but he passes them on to his
adversary, so that he gains an advantage in more
ways than one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART IV.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE "COUP D'ÉCARTÉ."</span></h3>

<blockquote class="sub">
<p class="center">The King and the Vole.</p></blockquote>

<p>Before commencing this article on Écarté, I
wish to point out an error very generally diffused
among players.</p>

<p>When speaking of a swindler, people are apt to
say, "He is a man who turns up the king whenever
he pleases." This is a decided error. A Greek,
if he is clever, will never do anything so imprudent.
He knows very well that, by turning up a
king too often, he arouses suspicion, and only
marks one point; whereas, by keeping it in his
own hand, he enjoys the advantage of marking two.
In the same way, a sharper of experience will never
deal himself so good a hand as that which I am
about to describe, because such an assemblage of
trumps would create doubts in the mind of his
opponent.</p>

<p>The following hand must, therefore, only be
regarded as an example, of what can be done by
tricking at écarté.</p>

<h4>ARRANGEMENT OF THE PACK.</h4>

<p>The Greek, whilst shuffling the cards with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
apparent indifference, has quietly introduced underneath
the pack a sixième-major, or sequence of
six cards from the king (the highest card at écarté)
downwards.</p>

<p>This done, nothing is easier than for him to arrange
the cards, so that they will fall to him in the deal.</p>

<p>To effect this, while pretending to shuffle, he
puts alternately on the <span class="locked">pack&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. Four cards from beneath (good).</li>
<li>2. Three cards from the middle (bad).</li>
<li>3. Two cards from beneath (good).</li>
<li>4. Two cards from the middle (bad).</li>
</ul>

<p>This performance ended, he makes a false cut,
as described in the first chapter, and deals.</p>

<p>Contrary to his principles, he will turn up the
king, and hold in his own hand a sequence from
the queen of trumps downwards.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART V.<br />

<span class="subhead">A JEU DE RÈGLE.<a name="FNanchor_M" id="FNanchor_M" href="#Footnote_M" class="fnanchor smaller">M</a></span></h3>

<p>From the preceding tricks, it will be seen that
it is necessary for the Greek, before he begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
playing, to put a certain number of cards into the
pack, both at the top and underneath, all of which
he arranges in readiness to be dealt to him.</p>

<p>This he does whilst pretending to shuffle them,
and almost always in the midst of an animated
conversation about the hand which has just been
played. All this he performs so naturally that
it is never observed.</p>

<p>A sharper, who understands his business, never
amuses himself with essaying "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tours de force</i>,"
but is content with a few good cards, of which he
knows how to make the best use.</p>

<p>His manner of acting under such circumstances
is very simple.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the first hand has been
played out, and it is now the Greek's turn to deal.</p>

<p>He gathers up, as usual, the eleven cards which
are on the table; but, in so doing, he, with great
dexterity, separates all the cards of one suit,
and places them on the <i>talon</i>, the rest he puts
underneath.</p>

<p>Suppose the cards chosen by him are the <span class="locked">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. The king of hearts.</li>
<li>2. The ace of hearts.</li>
<li>3. The ten of hearts.</li>
<li>4. The seven of hearts.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
In order that the last of these cards may be
turned up, and that the three others may be in his
own hand, he need only put above them the first
cards that come, to make the number eleven, which
can be easily done whilst pretending to shuffle.</p>

<p>After which, he makes a false cut, by means of
the Bridge, or any other of the methods given in
the first chapter, and deals.</p>

<p>The Greek now holds in his own hand the
king, ace, and ten of hearts. As to the other two
cards he trusts to chance, not caring much whether
they are good or bad.</p>

<p>Should you have any doubts about the honesty
of your adversary, the way to detect this cheat is to
watch the cards which are taken up, and especially
to observe whether those cards, which have been
used in a previous hand, do not appear again in
his play.</p>

<span class="subhead">LANSQUENET.</span></h3>

<blockquote class="sub">
<p class="center">The "Dépôt de Portées."</p></blockquote>

<p>This trick is about the most simple and dangerous
that I have yet described, and the performance
of it is unfortunately very easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
The Greek must place on the pack, at the
moment when he is dealer, a series of cards, called
"portées," so as to secure beforehand several
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">refaits</i>.</p>

<p>These "portées" are composed of ten cards,
and are arranged, for example, as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li class="figspace">1. Queen.</li>
<li class="figspace">2. Queen.</li>
<li class="figspace">3. Ten.</li>
<li class="figspace">4. Seven.</li>
<li class="figspace">5. Ten.</li>
<li class="figspace">6. Nine.</li>
<li class="figspace">7. Nine.</li>
<li class="figspace">8. Ace.</li>
<li class="figspace">9. Eight.</li>
<li>10. Ace.</li>
</ul>

<p>When this "portée" is exhausted, the Greek
passes on the cards.</p>

<p>These cards are placed in such a manner about
the sharper, as to allow him to get at them with
ease.</p>

<p>To show you how this is done, I must strip my
sharper of his coat.</p>

<p>It will be seen that, in the waistcoat of
<a href="#ip_228">the figure</a> on the next page, there are two pockets,
called "costières," which are made on the left side.</p>

<p>When it is his turn to deal, he leans forward
on the table, and, in so doing, brings his hand as
near as possible to his "portées;" thus he can,
when he pleases, take them out, as is shown in the
fourth chapter, and put them on the pack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
The Greek having his coat buttoned at the top,
this proceeding is prevented from being seen,
and the opening at the bottom enables him to put
his hand inside, without it being noticed.</p>

<p>Some Greeks are expert enough to abstract
several <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">refaits</i> from the pack itself, and put them
into their side-pockets in readiness for their next
hand. Others keep them hidden in their hand,
and await an opportune moment for replacing
them on the pack. So that, in this manner, there
are never more cards in a pack than there ought
to be.</p>

<span class="subhead">ON GAMES WITH FOUR PLAYERS.</span></h3>

<p>It may be imagined, that in a game where there
are four people playing, cheating is impracticable,
since the cards the sharper ought to deal, are
collected and shuffled by another person.</p>

<p>The reader may remember that in one of the
chapters, at the beginning of this work, I have
given him a concise explanation of this very
subject. This explanation I will now complete.</p>

<p>At the game of Bouillotte, for example, a Greek
makes an agreement with an accomplice, whom he
places near him.</p>

<p>This accomplice, while collecting and shuffling
the cards, arranges them for the following hand.
The trick will cause no suspicion; for it is not to the
Greek who deals the cards, but to his confederate,
that the good hand comes. Besides, these gentlemen
always pretend to be unacquainted with each
other.</p>

<p>There are numerous other tricks in which no
second party is required, and which are all contained
in the general rules I have laid down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Again, I have sometimes heard it observed, that
a Greek cannot exercise his vocation in the higher
class of clubs, as they are so strictly watched.</p>

<p>He will certainly not venture, in these <i>réunions</i>,
in the midst of a crowd of lookers on, all more or
less interested in the game, to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sauter la coupe</i>,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">filer la carte</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c. But, can he not have
recourse to other deceptions, where there is no
danger of discovery?</p>

<p>The marked cards, for example: can he not bribe
a servant, by offering him half the profits, to let
him have the packs of cards before giving them to
the players?</p>

<p>The telegraph also is equally available, even
before the most critical observers.</p>

<p>The Greek of fashionable life has sufficient tact
and <i>finesse</i> to cope with any situation, however
difficult, in which he may be placed; and when
he makes up his mind to cheat, he generally
succeeds.</p>

<p>If he does not venture on sleight of hand in
public, he makes use of it in small parties, where
the players are not conspicuous for their intelligence
and perspicacity.</p>

<p>Far be it from me to say, that wherever there are
players, there must be rogues; on the contrary, I
believe that in many clubs such a character is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
unknown; still, that is no reason that sooner or
later a Greek might not gain entrance there, and
exercise his infamous vocation.</p>

<p class="center">Piquet&mdash;Écarté&mdash;Baccarat&mdash;Impériale&mdash;Whist&mdash;Bouillotte&mdash;Bézigue&mdash;&amp;c., &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the former chapter I have given various examples
of serious cheats performed by Greeks.</p>

<p>I shall now present to my readers, a series of
what may be termed entertaining tricks; they are
done in such a way that a juggler may, whilst
amusing his spectators, show them how easily they
may be cheated at every game.</p>

<p>Let us go back to the preceding <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de piquet</i>,
which we will now perform in a more agreeable
manner.</p>

<p>We will suppose the juggler to have in his <span class="locked">hand&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. A sixième of spades.</li>
<li>2. A quatorze of aces.</li>
<li>3. A quatorze of kings.</li>
</ul>

<p>His adversary is the elder hand; it is for him to
call; he announces a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sixième</i> from the queen;
for, as he has the chance of a sequence in three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
suits, it is most probable that he will succeed with
one.</p>

<p>"Six cards," says he.</p>

<p>"What do they count?"</p>

<p>"Fifty-four."</p>

<p>"That's not good. Is that all you have to
declare?"</p>

<p>"Yes; for it is not likely that my three queens
will turn out valueless."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" You then spread your <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sixième</i> major
on the table, and say&mdash;sixteen and six make
twenty-two; and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quatorze</i> of kings (you show them)
ninety-six; and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quatorze</i> of aces, a hundred and
ten.</p>

<p>These two <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quatorzes</i> have all this time been
hidden in your left hand.</p>

<p>Here I must explain, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par parenthèse</i>, something
which it will be necessary for my readers to know,
so as to understand what follows. While continuing
the counting of this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de piquet</i>, we will
secretly prepare a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup d'écarté</i>, which we will
execute after this game.</p>

<p>Let us take up the counting where we left off.</p>

<p>"A hundred and ten," we have said. "A hundred
and eleven," you say, taking up the nine of spades
of your <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sixième</i>, and putting it on one side&mdash;"a
hundred and twelve," putting the ten on it; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
continuing your calculation, you do the same with
the other four cards; with this difference, that
when you come to the king, you put the ace
before him, so that he may be the last card in the
pack.</p>

<p>In finishing your counting, you put the three
kings and the three aces on these six cards, which
brings it to a hundred and twenty-three. This,
with forty for the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">capot</i>, makes a hundred and sixty-three.</p>

<p>The pack not being played out, the cards have
not been shuffled, and it is easy, with the slight preparation
I have just pointed out, to arrange the
following <i>coup</i>.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">PART I.<br />

<span class="subhead">ÉCARTÉ.</span></h3>

<blockquote class="sub">
<p class="center">An Amusing Game at Écarté.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the arrangement of the cards
mentioned in the preceding trick, you have in
hand six spades, three kings, and three aces, which
you put on the pack.</p>

<p>You then take up, with apparent indifference, the
three cards of your discard, which you have left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
close to yourself, and place them under the two
first cards; then, by a false shuffle, you pass two
of the undermost cards of the pack to the top.</p>

<p>This manœuvre arranges the cards in the following
manner:</p>

<p>Two indifferent cards.</p>

<p>Two spades.</p>

<p>Three indifferent cards.</p>

<p>Four spades&mdash;one of which is a king, and will
serve as the turn-up card.</p>

<p>Afterwards come the three kings and three aces.</p>

<p>This operation is performed whilst a conversation
is being carried on, and without your having declared
your intention to continue playing; then you place
the pack on the table.</p>

<p>"You see," say you, "the danger of playing at
cards. A sharper would not make a joke of it,
and, with such chances at his disposal, he would
soon see the bottom of your purse."</p>

<p>"By the bye, do you know another game for
two to play at? Écarté, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I do."</p>

<p>"Oh! very well! Then let us play a game at
écarté."</p>

<p>We take the pack already prepared; we make a
false shuffle, a false cut, and we deal the cards.</p>

<p>"I am going to turn up the king," you say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
"Here he is; and I have a handful of trumps."
You throw down the five trumps in succession on
the table, saying, "Trump, trump," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<blockquote class="sub">

<p>"The <i>vole</i> and the king. I mark three; it is
your turn to deal," presenting the pack to your
adversary; and, at the same time, drawing out
five or six cards which you keep hidden in your
hand, according to the principles laid down in the
third chapter, <a href="#ip_173">figure 13</a>.</p>

<p>The adversary shuffles the cards, and, that he
shall not notice the diminution of the pack, you
distract his attention by an animated conversation.
Something in this style.</p>

<p>"Have you any knowledge of sleight of hand?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for it, as I would have taught you
a trick."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's of no consequence; show it to me
all the same."</p>

<p>"With pleasure. But you must first practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
a whole year to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sauter la coupe</i>," &amp;c., &amp;c. Your
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> then hands the cards to you to cut, and
deals. Taking up your cards, you pass in underneath,
those you had secreted, being careful to
press them very forcibly one against the other.</p>

<p>"Ah! Well, what game did you say we were
to play at?"</p>

<p>"At écarté; I thought you said at écarté."</p>

<p>"Then why do you give me so many cards?"
spreading out the cards side by side.</p>

<p>"A false deal. You've lost your deal," you
exclaim, at the same time passing with a rapid
glance all the cards in review before you.</p>

<p>This hasty glance, rapid as it is, has been long
enough to show you, out of these eleven or twelve
cards, which is the dominant suit.</p>

<p>You select four of them, and, as you ought to
recollect, the three kings and three aces were
amongst them.</p>

<p>To the four above-mentioned you add the king
and the ace of hearts, and place them all together
at the bottom of the pack; then, by an operation
similar to that described for piquet, whilst pretending
to shuffle, you put on the top of the
<span class="locked">pack&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. Four cards from the bottom.</li>
<li>2. Three indifferent cards from the middle.</li>
<li>3. Two cards from the bottom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></li>
<li>4. Two indifferent cards.</li>
</ul>

<p>The pack is accordingly thus arranged for playing.
Eleven prepared cards. That is to <span class="locked">say&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. Two chance cards.</li>
<li>2. Two hearts.</li>
<li>3. Three chance cards.</li>
<li>4. Three hearts.</li>
<li>5. A heart, as the turn-up card.</li>
</ul>

<p>You make a false shuffle, a false cut, and then
proceed to deal.</p>

<p>"I turned up the king just now," you observe,
in finishing the deal. "This time I shall keep it
in my own hand." You mark the king, and make
the point, which wins the game.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE "COUP D'ÉCARTÉ."</span></h3>

<blockquote class="sub">

<p>Thus, as I have just explained, in collecting the
cards, you select a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sixième-major</i> in whichever
suit you please, put it at the bottom of the pack,
and add in succession the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. One card from the bottom.</li>
<li>2. Three chance cards from the middle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></li>
<li>3. Three cards from the bottom.</li>
<li>4. Two chance cards from the middle.</li>
<li>5. Two cards from the bottom.</li>
</ul>

<p>A false shuffle, a false cut, and then deal first
two, then three.</p>

<p>In arranging your cards you must not let the
king be the turn-up card.</p>

<blockquote class="sub">
<p class="center">In which the Adversary loses a Bet he has made, judging from

<p>Put on the top of the pack the following eleven

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
The cards by this manœuvre will be thus divided:</p>

<p class="p1 in0 in4 b0">THE DEALER.</p>

<ul class="p0">
<li>The king of hearts.</li>
<li>The knave of hearts.</li>

<p>The turn-up card is the eight of hearts.</p>

<p>"Oh! good Heavens!" you exclaim, laying
down your trio of sevens on the table, "what
dreadful cards!" But you are careful not to display
the king and knave of hearts.</p>

<p>"But, notwithstanding" (you continue), "I have
such luck, that even with this bad hand I may win
the game after all."</p>

<p>Your adversary, knowing the splendid hand he
holds, falls into the trap, and bets largely that he
will make the point. He plays with confidence,
but let him play as he will, he cannot help losing
three tricks, as two of his trumps must fall to
your small cards, and your seven of trumps will
prevent his winning with the king of diamonds.
You still have in your hand what is vulgarly called

Thirty-two Cards, you make, at the first "coup," five
hundred and ten points, without your Adversary having
been able to mark a single one.</p></blockquote>

<p>This game is very amusing, and merits a description
of its <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mise en scène</i>. This we shall give
after the cards are cut.</p>

<p>Put at the bottom of the pack, the seventeen
cards which follow:</p>

<ul>
<li class="figspace">1. Ten of hearts.</li>
<li class="figspace">2. Ten of clubs.</li>
<li class="figspace">3. Ten of diamonds.</li>
<li class="figspace">4. King of hearts.</li>
<li class="figspace">5. King of clubs.</li>
<li class="figspace">6. King of diamonds.</li>
<li class="figspace">7. Ace of hearts.</li>
<li class="figspace">8. Ace of clubs.</li>
<li class="figspace">9. Ace of diamonds.</li>
<li>10. Ace of spades.</li>
<li>11. King of spades.</li>
<li>12. Queen of spades.</li>
<li>13. Knave of spades.</li>
<li>14. Ten of spades.</li>
<li>15. Nine of spades,</li>
<li>16. Seven of spades.</li>
<li>17. Eight of spades.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="smaller">CLASSIFICATION, UNDER PRETENCE OF SHUFFLING.</h4>

<p>Place in succession on the top of the pack:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. The five last (five spades).</li>
<li>2. Three indifferent cards.</li>
<li>3. Three cards from the bottom of the pack (three spades).</li>
<li>4. Four indifferent cards.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
The classification above mentioned, ought to
answer for both packs. The "talon," or stock,
must then be arranged, so that all the cards necessary
for you to win the game with will come
successively into your hands. For this purpose,
you must change the form of your false shuffle,
and continue thus:</p>

<p>1st. Take in your right hand, the fourteen first
cards, which have been placed on the top of the
pack.</p>

<p>2nd. Hold the rest of the pack in your left hand
between the thumb and four fingers, then slip in
successively under the packet in your right hand:</p>

<p>1st. With the thumb of the left hand, the cards
on the top of this packet.</p>

<p>2nd. With the four fingers of the same hand, the
bottom card of the same packet.</p>

<p>3rd. With the thumb of the left hand, the upper
card, and so on, to the end of the packet.</p>

<p>To be certain that you are doing it all right, you
have only to look at the last card, which ought to
be a ten.</p>

<p>The cards should appear in the following order:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Three useless cards.</li>
<li>2. Three good cards.</li>
<li>3. Three useless cards.</li>
<li>4. Three good cards.</li>
<li>5. The seven of spades (the turn-up card).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></li>
<li>6. The eight of spades.</li>
<li>7. A useless card.</li>
<li>8. The ace of hearts.</li>
<li>9. A useless card.</li></ul>

<p>And in the same way for the aces, the three kings,
and the three tens, which ought to be separated
from each other by indifferent cards.</p>

<p>Then a false cut, and deal three cards at a
time.</p>

<p>"When the game of Bézigue was first invented,"
you say to your adversary, "they used to play with
the same number of cards as at Piquet, making
five hundred points the game; and, in consequence
of the small quantity of cards, each player had
never more than six cards in his hand at a time.
Let us do things as they ought to be done, and
play it in that way."</p>

<p>"Remember, sir, that I warned you that I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
make five hundred points, before you marked one.
But if you have the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">brisques</i> (the four tens) you may
count them. I will, however, save you unnecessary
trouble, by getting them myself," and you take them
in, one after the other.</p>

<p>"The turn-up card is yours by right, but, that it
may not injure me I am going to trump it, which
makes me game. Thus, ten for the last card, and
twenty for <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">brisques</i>, make thirty, which, added to four
hundred and eighty, make five hundred and ten."</p>

<p>It must be understood, that in this game you
must take every trick, so as to be always the first to
play.</p>

<p>This game is certainly a difficult one to play, but
it has the advantage of producing a very brilliant
effect.</p>

<p>As this arrangement of the cards, would be much
too long a proceeding to enact before your adversary,
the best plan is to have a pack of cards ready
prepared, and to exchange them for those on the
table, before beginning to play.</p>

<p>Make a false cut, and deal three at a time.</p>

<p>After which, you commence by showing cartes-blanches
(which counts ten), then discard the seven,
eight, and nine of diamonds; and, if required, the
eight of spades. If your adversary leaves, as he
ought to do, a card on the <i>talon</i>, you have, by the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rentrée</i> of the queen of clubs, the knave of clubs,
and the knave of hearts, a sixième in clubs, and a
quint in hearts, with which you repique, and make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
hundred and seven points. You will be the winner,
even if you are capoted.</p>

<p>For, your adversary having discarded, according
to the rules of the game, the queen, knave, nine, and
seven of spades, has taken for his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rentrée</i> the king
and queen of hearts, the king of clubs, and the king
of spades.</p>

<p>He will hold in his hand a quint major in diamonds,
a quatorze of aces, and a quatorze of kings,
with which, had they been good, he would have
made one hundred and forty-nine points.</p>

<li>32. The ten of clubs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The four cards marked with an asterisk are large
cards.</p>

<p>By the arrangement of the cards in the order
above, it is evident that, if the pack is cut where
one of the large cards, which are the last of each
suit, is placed, there will always remain in the talon
eight cards of the same suit; consequently, if your
adversary wishes to be repiqued in clubs, in cutting
the pack at the first large card, which is the seven
of clubs, you necessarily put the eight clubs at the
bottom of the pack, and you will have for your
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rentrée</i> a quint major in clubs.</p>

<p>This will be the case with all the suits in cutting
at the seventh card.</p>

<p>Your adversary having expressed a wish to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
repiqued in clubs, his wish will be gratified if the
cards are dealt two at a time.</p>

<p>When your adversary has named the suit in
which he wishes to be repiqued, and which we will
suppose to be clubs, you must cut at the seven of
this suit, and then tell him he is at liberty to have
the cards dealt to him in twos or threes, whichever
he pleases.</p>

<p>The cards having been dealt out, either in one way
or the other, you then tell your adversary that he
may, before looking at them, select whichever of the
packs of cards he likes, provided he will agree to be
second hand.</p>

<p>Should the cards have been given in twos, and
each one retains his own hand, you must discard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
nines of hearts, spades, and diamonds, and two
queens of any suit.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rentrée</i> will be a quint major in clubs, a
quatorze of aces, and a quatorze of kings, with
which, of course, you make a repique.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, your adversary chooses to be
the first player, you will discard the sevens of hearts,
spades, and diamonds, and two eights of any suit.
This will give you, for your <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rentrée</i>, the same quint
in clubs, a quatorze of queens, and a quatorze of
knaves, which will equally produce a repique.</p>

<p>If your adversary, instead of having the cards
dealt in twos, prefers that they should be given in
threes, and that he keeps his own hand, you must
discard the king, the eight and the seven of hearts,
and the nine and eight of spades, so as to have for
your <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rentrée</i> a quint major in clubs, a tierce from
the queen in diamonds, three aces, three queens,
and three knaves, with which you repique.</p>

<p>If he chooses to be the first player, you will
discard the queen and the nine of hearts, the knave
and the seven of spades, and the ace of diamonds.</p>

<p>By this you will have, for your <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rentrée</i>, the same
quint major in clubs, a tierce from the nine in
diamonds, three kings, and three tens, which will
make twenty-nine points. In playing, you will
only make sixty the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Although we have supposed the repique to have
been asked for in clubs by your adversary, it must
be clearly understood, that it may be similarly done
in any other suit; and it is only necessary, as has
been already explained at the beginning of this
chapter, to cut at the seven of the suit called for.</p>

<span class="subhead">MINOR CHEATS OF MEN OF THE WORLD.</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">Ruses and Frauds allowable by custom in Society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the ordinary affairs of life, it is easy to know
the difference between honesty and roguery: conscience
and the laws have traced a line of demarcation,
about which all right-minded people agree.</p>

<p>In the matter of play, it is not the same thing:
one knows perfectly where roguery ends, but it is
very difficult to say where it begins?</p>

<p>Let me hasten to give an explanation, without
which my readers will have a right to call me to
task.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to pretend," they will say, "that
a man of sense is not capable of discriminating
between honesty and roguery?" This would, indeed,
be giving too great a position to cheating.</p>

<p>I at once disclaim the assertion of any such
opinion; none believe more in honesty than myself.
But for that firm belief, this work would probably
never have seen the light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
But let a man be ever so upright and just in his
play, there are houses where certain licences are
allowed, where the play is not high enough, to
make it worth a man's while to cheat.</p>

<p>These peccadilloes, may for want of a better
appellation, be termed clever manœuvres, finesses,
ruses, and mental sleight-of-hand.</p>

<p>Of these I will just mention a few, beginning
with the most innocent, and progressing by degrees,
until I come to actual sharping. At the same time
I must request my readers to fix their own limits,
where honesty ends and roguery begins.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>For instance, if you are playing with an awkward
adversary, who, in arranging his cards, classes his
trumps too ostensibly, ought you, therefore, to
avoid taking advantage of this awkwardness, as a
guide to your adversary's hand?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Again, if your adversary, through carelessness,
shows his cards, or if, by holding them too near
the candle, they are rendered transparent: is it
necessary to tell him of it?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Then, in playing Écarté. What is to be said of
an adversary who consults the bye-standers, as if
he had the right to do so, as to whether he shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
play or not, and who, after a little hesitation,
decides to discard? From thus acting it might be
supposed, that he had a first-rate hand, and that
prudence alone prompted the question. Do not be
taken in: He will discard all his five cards. He
wished to deceive his adversary, and if the latter
is inexperienced, he will succeed in so doing.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Another man will, before proposing, look at his
counters, as if to mark the king, then, after giving
you this false alarm, he asks for cards, and is only
too glad if you acquiesce in his request: for not
only had he no king at all, but a very bad hand.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>You are still playing at Écarté, and you have
three points, but your adversary is doubtless in
ignorance of the fact, since he inquires of you,
where you are? "I count three," you reply. This
announcement seems to make him decide not to
stand on his own cards, so he proposes. From
this, you would suppose he had a good hand. You
would be wrong in this case to refuse, so you accept
and give him <i>five</i> cards, as all this little bye-play was
intended to intimidate you. He had nothing at all.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Some players endeavour to depict on their
countenances, the contrary of what they really feel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
If they have a good hand, they eagerly ask for cards,
and when they have a bad one, they pretend to
hesitate. Others, with good cards, pretend to be in
a bad temper, and frown; whilst, with bad cards,
they appear gay and anxious to begin to play.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It sometimes happens that a player, at the end
of a game, is puzzled which of the two last cards
he is to throw down. One of them may save the
vole, but he is not sure which. Instead of playing
according to the proverb, which says <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">qui
garde à carreau n'est pas capot</i>, he holds down
his hand, so that his adversary may see both cards,
and fixes his eyes upon those of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i>, which
very naturally, are bent on the card which is against
himself. The other profits by this look, and saves
himself from being capoted.</p>

<p>This is an infallible criterion, but is it a right
thing to do?</p>

<p>The following anecdote is related on this subject,
and will not be out of place here:</p>

<p>At a game of Piquet, in which many were greatly
interested, one of the players was on the point of
being capoted. He had but two cards to play,
the king of hearts, and the king of spades. One
of these would save him, if he only played the
right one; but which? He laid them both down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
on the table, and, after some hesitation, he decided
on playing the king of spades, when he felt some
one press his foot. Accepting this indication as
a warning, he changed his intention, played the
king of hearts, and lost the game. It was the
king of spades he ought to have played. Vexed
at the error he had committed, he asked who it
was that pressed his foot, and found out it was his
adversary. The latter apologised, pretending it
was by accident. In this instance, again, the
reader must judge for himself of the honesty of
both the players.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>When a game of Écarté is being played, it is
not considered right, first to bet on one side, and
then on the other. Whether you bet or not, you
always continue on the same side.</p>

<p>There are people, however, who even manage to
win on both sides, and this is the way they
manage it:</p>

<p>Two persons agree to make their interest common,
and place themselves on opposite sides of the
table. If a good hand is dealt to either party, the
accomplice makes a sign to his friend, and he
accordingly bets high. The other, meanwhile,
makes no bet this time. When fortune appears in
favour of the opposite party, the stakes change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
sides. These manœuvres are very innocent, no
doubt, but they are not acknowledged.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In games of four players, as in Whist, for
example, you ought to make no communication
whatever to your partner, except such as are authorised
and allowed by the rules of the game. To
this no objection can be made, as it is equally
open to both sides: but some players make a
series of signs, and nervous contractions of the
muscles of the face, which enlighten their partner
considerably as to what sort of hand they have.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In playing Écarté, whilst shuffling the cards,
some players allow their adversary to see the card
at the bottom of the pack. There are some persons
who take advantage of this negligence. This is the
little manœuvre which they <span class="locked">employ:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The dealer offers the cards to his adversary to
cut. This is done in such a manner as to leave
only about eleven cards, which will, of course, go on
the top of the pack. The observer, therefore, well
knows, that if that card is not in his own hand, it
must be in that of his adversary; and every Écarté
player is aware, of how much consequence it is, to
know even one card in the hand of your adversary,
in that game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
The following facts I particularly commend to
the attention of my readers.</p>

<p>Every one knows, that in certain games, Écarté
especially, the cards are apt to run in suits, the
reason of which is evident, as, in playing, one is
always obliged to follow suit.</p>

<p>Without you try the thing yourself, you will
scarcely believe it; but if the cards be ever so well
shuffled, it is very difficult to separate any two or
three cards, which have been played together.</p>

<p>An expert player will derive great advantage,
from the glimpse he obtains whilst his opponent
is shuffling the cards.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, for example, that he has seen
amongst the cards a sequence from the king, as
the king, queen, and knave of hearts. It is more
than probable, that the above cards, after the
shuffle, still remain together; and if, after the deal,
you have the king in your own hand, and it was
the second of the two cards dealt to you first, you
may be pretty sure that the queen and knave,
following close after, are in your adversary's hand.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the knave is the first card
of the three next that are dealt to you, your adversary
will have the king and queen. Again, if the
king is turned up, the two others will be the
next to follow in the <i>talon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
To obtain these results, may not a person, in
spite of himself, be led into neglecting to shuffle
the cards too well?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It often happens at the game of Bouillotte, that
a player who has a bad hand, proposes to play for
a very considerable stake; this is done merely to
alarm his opponent. This <i>finesse</i> sometimes succeeds,
but it is of too gross a character, to be
tolerated in many clubs.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>As a <i>finale</i> to this collection of minor tricks, more
or less allowable in play, I will cite an anecdote,
which, true or not, the world gives the credit of
to M. de Talleyrand.</p>

<p>Talleyrand was once playing at Bouillotte; he
had just dealt the cards, and was waiting, according
to the rules of the game, to stake.</p>

<p>The two first adversaries allowed their turn to
pass, without risking anything.</p>

<p>"Ten louis," said the third player.</p>

<p>"Twenty," said Talleyrand.</p>

<p>"Forty," said the adversary.</p>

<p>"I stake my all," continued the Diplomatist,
pointing to the hundred louis before him, and, at
the same time, he let a card fall out of his hand on
the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
It was a nine; he took it up again hastily.</p>

<p>His adversary had just time to see the card,
and, although he had a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">brelan</i> of kings, he thought
it more prudent to stop betting.</p>

<p>He concluded that Talleyrand must have a first-rate
hand, to back it so heavily. He was led to
this opinion, because the turn-up card was a nine,
and in all probability, the nine which fell from
the hands of the Diplomatist, was one of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">brelan</i>
of four.</p>

<p>Each player laid his hand on the table; Talleyrand
gained with three odd cards, amongst which
was the nine he had dropped insidiously on the
table to deceive his adversary.</p>

<p>Here I had better stop; for, if I continued such
stories for many more pages, I fear that the heading
of this chapter would be insensibly merged in those
which have preceded it. My readers must, however,
by this time, be sufficiently edified on the
nature of the rogueries I have exposed, and will
be strengthened in the opinion, that an honourable
player ought only to take the advantages offered
him by his own good fortune or good play.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>My task is ended. Allow me, dear reader, to
disclose to you an apprehension, which has haunted
me throughout this work. This apprehension you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
will more easily understand if I preface it, by way
of illustration, with the following apologue.</p>

<p>You have, doubtless, witnessed the singular
spectacle of two men fighting in the public highway,
and, suddenly reconciled, turning their united
strength against the officious persons who separate
them.</p>

<p>In a similar manner, does not the author of these
pages run the same risk?</p>

<p>May it not happen, that the losers and the winners,
the dupes as well as the rogues, may regard
him as their common enemy?</p>

<p>The infatuated gamblers will reproach him for
making them afraid of being robbed, and thereby
preventing them from playing.</p>

<p>The Greeks will be sure to hate him, for having
unmasked their knaveries.</p>

<p>These considerations, you see, have not prevented
me from following out the task I had
imposed upon myself, and, whatever happens, I
trust the public will give me credit for a wish to
enlighten them, and for having had their interest
more at heart even than my own.</p>

Robertson, in his Memoirs, thus describes it:&mdash;In the centre of the

</p>
<p>
If "Pair" is the favourite, and large stakes are on it, the spring

which are larger.
